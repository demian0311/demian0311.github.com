## Training
### Boot Camp
I was in boot-camp at MCRD San Diego from September to December in 1990.  

In boot-camp my main concern was just getting through the massive mind-fuck.  To
that end I mostly blended in and tried to not attract the attention of the
drill instructors.  I remember imagining myself blending into whatever furniture
I was standing next to, a bed or a footlocker.

I must've had good hand-writing because the DIs made me a t-card recruit.  
That means I would write out the days training on index cards for the drill
instructors so they could stick it in their smokey.  You'd see them occasionally
refer to it during the day.

In second phase you go to the field.  I remember when we were training the Secretary
of Defense, Dick Cheney, was on a tour of Camp Pendleton and walked through our area.

I graduated boot-camp as a PFC because I helped recruit a couple high-school friends.

### Marine Combat Training
Marine Combat Training at Camp Pendleton was a school after boot-camp that all Marines had to
go to.  Now only non-infantry Marines have to go to this school.  It's like
a miniature infantry school.  The Marines are big on everyone being a capable
infantryman.

I fell in with _Humping Hotel_ company.  Humping is the word for long, forced
marches.  We marched a lot.  At least once we marched over 20 miles with a 
full pack on.  If I have to point to where I got _hard_ it was in MCT.  The
first Gulf War was heating up and everyone thought it was going to be a real
fight so the instructors were especially hard on us.  Some of them got a little
too _handsy_ and I believe there was an investigation resulting in at least
one of them losing rank.  None the less I am thankful for the training. 

### School of Infantry

I enlisted as guaranteed infantry.  My primary MOS was 0311, infantry rifleman.  When you 
think of a Marine this is probably the job you imagine most of them doing.  The School of
Infantry is where infantry Marines are trained.

SOI right next door to MCT at Camp Pendleton.  This was a longer
school but it wasn't quite as tough or I was harder.  About half-way throught the school
I picked up a squad leader role in SOI and got a meritorious promotion to Lance Corporal 
when I graduated SOI.

During this school the first Iraq War was in full swing.  I remember some other Marines
listening to George Bush Senior on the radio.  He announced that our forces would not 
continue into Iraq and towards Baghdad.  The war was pretty much over.  There were more 
than a few Marines that were upset.  Some of them even dropped out of college to get in
on the war.

### Security Forces School

My secondary MOS was 8152, Security Force Guard.  At the time on the West Coast you went
to Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California to the Marine Corps Security Force
School.

Security Forces School was primarily about gaining proficiency with the shotgun and the
pistol.  Most infantry Marines don't use those weapons.  We used the Mossberg 590 shotgun
and the 1911 pistol.  The instruction was good, especially for pistol they ran great drills
that turned us into effective shooters.  

Room clearing or urban combat was also a big focus.  We practiced in shoot houses.  We also
did paint-ball training in a dry-docked Navy ship in nearby Vallejo.  

We also focused on terrorism and counter-terrorism.  Really just going through it's history
and motivation, common tactics, what to look out for and what to do if you find yourself in
a situation.

## Marine Corps Security Forces NAS Alameda

It's worth backing up and explaining how the Marines do Security Forces.  If you get into that
job you're first trained as an infantryman, then you're trained as a security guard.  Then in the
first half of your enlistment you work as a security guard.  I think it's because you get those
Marines fresh out of boot-camp.  They're not salty and surly.  They're highly disciplined, they
haven't been in the fleet and they are very respectful of authority.  The mission is usually
important and they want some locked-in Marines.

My first duty station was the Marine Security Forces at Naval Air Station, Alameda, California.  This
is the unit that I most identify with.  I met a lot of great Marines.

While at Alameda we did an annual training trip to Fort Ord, California.  The idea was that we
shouldn't forget about our infantry skills.  We used [MILES gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_integrated_laser_engagement_system).  One
thing I came to appreciate from this training was the importance of bringing gun-oil to the field.  For 
whatever reason we didn't bring any and our automatic rifles were too dry to cycle a round.  So 
we'd have to pull the charging hammer for every shot.

If you have ever watched the show _Myth Busters_ if they have something that needs a big area they
go over to the runway next to where we worked.  The base has long been de-commissioned.
