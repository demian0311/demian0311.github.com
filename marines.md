## Training
### Boot Camp
I was in boot-camp at MCRD San Diego from September to December in 1990.  

In boot-camp my main concern was just getting through the massive mind-fuck.  To
that end I mostly blended in and tried to not attract the attention of the
drill instructors.  

I must've had good hand-writing because the DIs made me a t-card recruit.  
That means I would write out the days training on index cards for the drill
instructors so they could stick it in their smokey.  You'd see them occasionally
refer to it during the day.

In second phase you go to the field.  I remember when we were training the Secretary
of Defense, Dick Cheney, was on a tour of Camp Pendleton and walked through our area.

I graduated boot-camp as a PFC because I helped recruit a couple high-school friends.

### Marine Combat Training
Marine Combat Training at Camp Pendleton was a school after boot-camp that all Marines had to
go to.  Now only non-infantry Marines have to go to this school.  It's like
a miniature infantry school.  The Marines are big on everyone being a capable
infantryman.

I fell in with _Humping Hotel_ company.  Humping is the word for long, forced
marches.  We marched a lot.  At least once we marched over 20 miles with a 
full pack on.  If I have to point to where I got _hard_ it was in MCT.  The
first Gulf War was heating up and everyone thought it was going to be a real
fight so the instructors were especially hard on us.  Some of them got a little
too _handsy_ and I believe there was an investigation resulting in at least
one of them losing rank.  None the less I am thankful for the training. 

### School of Infantry

The School of Infantry is right next door to MCT at Camp Pendleton.  This was a longer
school but it wasn't quite as tough or I was harder.  About half-way throught the school
I picked up a squad leader role in SOI and got a meritorious promotion to Lance Corporal 
when I graduated SOI.
