## The Iron
I think lifting weights teaches you a lot.  It can be a metaphor for
many things.  Understanding the concept of [delayed gratification](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-in-world/201207/the-power-delaying-gratification) 
is is one of the most obvious benefits of training.
Henry Rollins has a great story called [The Iron](http://www.oldtimestrongman.com/strength-articles/iron-henry-rollins), you should go read it.

Of course I want my boys to have as many opportunities as possible, I decided 
to start introducing them to weights more seriously with the new year.
They're aged 6 and 3.

In [Youngsters Need Strength Too](http://startingstrength.com/articles/young_strength_starr.pdf)
Bill Starr sites studies that show there is no effect on growth plates or any other overly cautionary
concerns most people have.   

## Goals

Advancing in weight is a distant concern.  Here are my goals for them 
in doing this.

- be able to lift safely
- have fun
- develop the habit of training (it's something you just do)
- know what hard work is
- understand good form 

## The Program

There's only one workout and this is it:

      exercise                sets  reps  weight
      ----------------------- ----- ----- ------
      press                   3     5     30
      kettlebell deadlift     3     5     26
      bench                   3     5     30
      kettlebell goblet squat 3     5     15
      rope pull 30 feet       3     1     26

Some random points and rationale about the workout:

- Workout twice a week not on consecutive days.
- *press* is a vertical push.
- *kettlebell deadlift* is vertical pull, covering posterior chain and core.
- *kettlebell deadlift* demonstrates a neutral spine.
- *bench* is a horizontal push.
- *kettlebell goblet squat* is quads and core. 
- *rope pull* is a horizontal pull, some posterior chain and core.

The rope pull is done with a 26 lb kettlebell tied to the end of a 30 foot 
battle rope.  The 3 year old pulls out the empty end of the rope and then 
the 6 year old pulls the weighted end towards him.  Rinse and repeat that
3 times.

The 6 year old is working on good form and staying safe.

The 3 year old does 3 reps of everything instead of 5.  Or instead of 3 reps
he does whatever the heck he wants to have fun.  Usually he's eager to show
how strong he is and he has a smile on his face.
