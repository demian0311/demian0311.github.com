After driving up the [Pacific Coast of Oregon](/2015/07/20/pacific-coast-of-oregon.html) and before going
to [OSCON in Portland](/2015/07/24/oscon-2015.html) we took a few days to see Seattle.

Once we got settled in the room we drove downtown to catch a ferry ride 
to [Tillicum Village](http://www.argosycruises.com/tillicum-village/).  Once
we got off the ferry they gave us a mug of steamed clams.  I nibbled on a bit, Ryder liked
them a lot.  After that you make your way to have a nice dinner of smoked salmon.  I
generally don't like fish but I tried the salmon, it was good, I can see the appeal.  Then
they put on a show of dances and talk about local native American mythology.  After that 
you hang out and get back on the boats.

The next day we drove down to [Pike Place Market](http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/).  That's where 
the fish market is.  We walked through that, it was crowded and touristy.  The fish mongers 
were nice, great ambassadors to the city.  We also went to 
the first Starbucks.  No video of that, the only thing different between that and other Starbucks
is that the line took 40 minutes instead of 10 minutes.

Then we went to the Seattle [EMP Museum](http://www.empmuseum.org/).  I guess
you could say it's a museum dedicated to contemporary culture.  There was a Star Wars costume 
exibit with many original costumes from the movies.

Besides that there was an exhibit on indy games.  I'm not much of a gamer but it was fun to
see the visual things indy game creators are doing.  The kids had fun playing the games.

Then we went up the [Space Needle](http://www.spaceneedle.com/).  It was confusing, 
we tried to get tickets and they said
they were sold out until 10PM.  Courtney managed to ask around and get reservations for the 
restaurant up there almost immediately and after you eat you can hang around on the observation
deck.  So it worked out great, the restaurant spins around once every 50 minutes.

Finally on our way to Portland we stopped off at [Crystal Mountain](http://crystalmountainresort.com/summer/summer-activities/scenic-gondola-rides/) to 
take a gondola ride up for a view of Mt Rainier and Mt St Helens.  We had lunch at a nice restaurant
at the top of the life and took in the views, great detour.
