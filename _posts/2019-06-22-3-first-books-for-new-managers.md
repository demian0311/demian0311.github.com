I've been back in management for a couple years now.  I did a previous stint for a few
years.  Along with that I have just under 20 years of experience as a developer.  I 
see management as another nut to crack, something else to get good at.  

So yeah, I don't see myself as an authority, just someone trying to get better.  As a developer
one of the things you need to get good at is learning and getting up to speed on
different topics. 

I think I'm getting up to speed on management and here are a few
books that I believe have helped me.  To be clear, I'm consuming _a lot_ of material
but these 3 books are the foundation.  These books are not just a starting
point they are material to continually review as you _progress_ and come at things 
from a different perspective.

## [The Obstacle Is the Way by Ryan Holiday](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00G3L1B8K&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_aMIdDb58JJK1A)

This could also have been [A Guide to the Good Life by William B. Irvine](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B0040JHNQG&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_EjIdDbWY1D938).  Both 
of the books are good introductions to stoic philosophy.  Stoicism will calm your
seas, it'll help you deal with adversity and jerks.  It will trade bad emotions
for good.  The most important lesson is that indeed you aren't along for the ride
as your emotions are tugged by events and your own biology.  You are at the helm.

As a manager (and a human for that matter) you'll be confronted with inconsiderate people, assholes and generally
crappy events.  Situations like this are a chance to show strength, character and grace.  Stoicism is the foundation for everything else.  Tim Ferris [has described](https://tim.blog/2011/05/18/philosophy-as-a-personal-operating-system-from-seneca-to-musashi/) stoicism 
as "the base foundation of an operating system for decision making".

The hope is that this book is the beginning of your dive into stoicism.  I should say
for me, reading the source material like [Meditations](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B000FC1JAI&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_8AIdDb6SD190V) is _rough_.  It's 
hard for me to pick out the nuggets.  After reading the books above work through
[The Daily Stoic](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B01HNJIJB2&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_dTIdDbYQQRNWC).

## [Getting Things Done by David Allen](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00KWG9M2E&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_nzIdDbSVAE5M1)

I'm a fraud, I'm bluffing my way through all this, I shouldn't even be where I'm at.  Luckily I
do have one thing going for me and that's _Getting Things Done_.  I'm taking some liberties here 
but for me the fundamental premise is that you have a brain in 3 modes.

The brain that...
- **thinks** of cool ideas that you can act on
- **organizes** those thoughts so you can _do_ something at the right time
- **acts** on those ideas

I recommend reading GTD.  Try not to fall into the trap of obsessing over your system, just 
start working with it.  Maybe go the physical route first using paper and folders.  

I personally
use [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) for GTD.  It's _just_ for Apple devices but
it's on my Macs, iPad, iPhone and Apple Watch.  It's powerful to capture those ideas and have
access to them in the right context no matter where I am.  

What GTD means in practice is that you are able to bring up the right things with people at the
right time.  You are generally regarded as being someone who follows through with their 
commitments.  Your creativity is more fully brought to bear in your work in that you have 
clarity and those great insights aren't lost.  You are just generally more effective.

The goal state with GTD is that you have a brain clear of those nagging un-met expectations.  You
have a _trusted system_ that is an extension of your brain.  You can be _in the moment_ wether it's
in a meeting, with a loved one or just relaxing.  That sense of being _clear_ is hard to express
but it's invaluable.  The latent stress is gone and you have more RAM and processing power 
available for creativity and taking in what should be your current focus.

Just a note with GTD, it takes work.  I've probably read the book 5 times and I listen to the 
audio book periodically.  You have to work the system, you don't get the benefits for free.  You
need to review daily or weekly, you need to structure it so that it works for you.


## [The Effective Manager by Mark Horstman](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B01H9E36OG&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_QzIdDbMF3727Z)

I've been a fan of [Manager Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com/) for 
a long time prior to the release of the book.  They have a few podcasts and if you're a 
professional, management or not, you need to listen to them.  To get started go to their [Basics](https://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics) set of podcasts.

The book is basically the same material that is covered in their _Basics_ podcast.  It's 
the minimal set of practices you should be doing with your people and why those things
are important.  Read the book, go through the _Basics_ podcasts, subscribe to their other
podcasts and start diving deep.  Lots of good stuff.

Manager Tools is lead by 2 West Point graduates with an engineering background
and a lot of experience in corporate America.  If you're coming to management from an engineering 
background their prescriptive approach and their guidance on dealing with behaviors and not 
emotions will resonate with you.  Their focus on relationships will get you out of your comfort 
zone but will make you better at your job.
