## Squat Fail 

For squats, it works best when you come up from 
the bottom at least as many times as you go down.
This month, I had some trouble getting out of the
hole.  Luckily I had the camera on me.  I've been
getting video more often because I want to keep an
eye on my depth.

Although I'm getting close to where I want to be
with my lifts I think I have stalled out a bit.

I had been approaching 315 but given my little stumble
here I decided to lower the weights and gradually work
my way back up.  An even 315 will have to wait for 
another few months.   

## What Happened

A buddy that saw the video noticed that my heels 
came up a bit such that I was on the balls of my
feet.  

- some bad shoulder mobility
- bar placement higher than normal
- back angle was too forward for the high bar placement
- ended up on the balls of my feet and lost my balance 

Besides lowering the weight I need to focus on sitting
back into the squat.  Keeping the weight on my heels.
