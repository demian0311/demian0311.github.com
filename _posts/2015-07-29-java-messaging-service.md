I read [Java Messaging Service 2nd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596522056.do).
I worked examples along with [ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/).  So far in my career I have
had no need I to use JMS.  There's a project at [work](http://www.timewarnercable.com/) that 
might use JMS so I am boning up on it.

Besides the examples in the book I used some code from [source4code.info](http://www.source4code.info/2014/11/jms-publish-subscribe-messaging-example-activemq-maven.html).  

It all seems like a very reasonable approach for systems to talk to each other.  
It's enterprisey though, makes me more eager to do some real-world work with
Akka actors.  That seems like a nicer way to introduce async into a project.
