## The Boys 
Bodhi is still in Cub Scouts but as of now Ryder hasn't joined a Boy Scout troop.

Ryder started at a STEM magnet school that goes from grade 6 through 12.  So he's on a campus
with much older kids.  Both of the boys are doing good in school.  The schools are on the other
side of town so getting them there is rough on Courtney.

The boys are still having fun with BJJ at [headkicks](http://www.headkicks.com/).  Ryder has been
in the _elite_ program at Headkicks for some time because he takes it seriously.  Bodhi has always
been a great competitor but in class he sometimes had a hard time focusing.  At the end of this 
year Bodhi finally was nominated to get into the elite classes.  This means he gets paired with
more serious kids in class, gets to wear a blue gi and on every other Friday he joins the elite
kids for some additional training.  At the same time Bodhi moved up to Ryder's class.  It's a lot
easier on our schedule.  So far Bodhi's rising to the occasion. 

Whenever we get a chance, usually once a week, the boys work out.  We have a game where they
pick exercises, we do a few rounds and for each set they throw darts to figure out the number
of reps.  The boys really like it.  For Ryder we've started doing something different.  He's 
doing barbell lifts (press, deadlift, bench, squat) and we're slowly progressing the weight.  We're 
focusing on good form so that when the hormones kick in he can safely get strong.

## Courtney
Courtney is still incredibly busy.  Her days are full as she continually finds ways to volunteer 
at the boys schools and in the community through various organizations like the Junior League.

We had a chance to ride in a [Mardi Gras parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Acnb90xT-9I) with 
Krewe of Rendezvous in Lafayette.  It was a lot of fun.

## Me 
I'm up to a 3rd stripe on my little BJJ white belt.  I'm not where one should be but it's a little
difficult with travel.  I'm still having a lot of fun learning, it's very physically and mentally 
challenging.  We're very fortunate to have a great gym close to our home.  It's great to do an
activity that the boys are also into.

### Work
I'm still a Sr Director at [Voyant](https://www.voyant.com/) in charge of some teams and awesome 
software engineers primarily in Boulder but we have a guy in Florida and a few people in Brazil.  I 
travel about twice a week.  In 2018 I logged 90 days at Hyatt hotels alone.
