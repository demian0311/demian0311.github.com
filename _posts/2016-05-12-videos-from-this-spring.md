## Denver 2016

The past couple years I managed to get 2 snowboarding trips back to Denver.  This season I only got one.  Mike took his
daughter Chloe for lessons at A-Basin so that's where we went.  Visibility could've been better but I can't complain. Work
flew a lot of people out so we could be in one place.  Enough of us were out such that our offices downtown Denver couldn't
hold us all so we went over to [Gavlanize](http://www.galvanize.com/).  It was great to see people, given the merger
not sure when or if I'll get back there.  Holy cow Denver is growing.

## Fat Tuesday

Mardi Gras in Lafayette, Louisiana is more about parades, Cajun food and family.  I'm sure you could stir up some
trouble but it's a tame affair for most.
