This seems to be a theme lately where I'm late to the party, taking a long time
to *get* something that is common knowledge to most folks.

## Groovy / Grails Support
I was beating my head against the wall using [GGTS](http://grails.org/products/ggts).
For example it was astonishing to me that GGTS didn't understand that I should have a 
[request](http://grails.org/doc/2.2.1/ref/Servlet%20API/request.html) available to me 
while working with Controllers.  No code completion, I was all on my own.  GGTS 
couldn't help me out at all.  Man I hope it's a PEBKAC problem but I couldn't get it working.

So I bit the bullet and started evaluating the newest version of IntelliJ.  After meeting
some resistance[^1] at work to justify the expense 
I decided to pay for a license out
of my own pocket.  That's how good I think it has been for my productivity.

## Scala and PlayFramework Support
What I have done in my day job is use the [TypeSafe Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/) 
for my Scala programming.  Really that wasn't going too bad at all.  TypeSafe is 
dog-fooding it and they're doing a pretty good job.  

IntelliJ also has great support for Scala and the PlayFramework.  After hours I'm playing
with Play, no complaints there.

I haven't fully pulled in our large Scala code-base at work quite yet.  We'll see how that
goes, not expecting much trouble.

## Productivity Boosters
One of the big things to re-map &#8984;-R to re-run my last tests.  I do that in
Eclipse and it works out really good.  I'm a very proficient with the keyboard but
day to day the function keys are dead to me.

Another big thing that has been helpful is the [IdeaVim](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164)
plugin.  It's 95% perfect for me.  I'm real quick to get around using it.  The last
5% that doesn't work the way I want is really just indenting and outdenting a block
of text.  It doesn't work the same way VIM does.  It's great to be able to keep my
brain in VIM mode.

[^1]: It's not quite as bad as it sounds, they paid for an older version of IntelliJ for me
previously but I wanted them to pay for the latest version.
