## Alaskan Cruise 2018 

We did an Alaskan cruise.  We flew from Lafayette to Seattle.  We
stayed in Seattle for a couple days and messed around downtown, do 
Pike Place and all that.  While
we were having dinner at one point Courtney and I started talking
about passports.  There we were, far from home we came to the 
conclusion that we probably should have brought our passports with
us.  Before then we sort of assumed that the cruise going from 
Seattle to Alaska with 1 stop in Canada wouldn't require us to get
passports.  Indeed, after Dinner we investigated and Royal Caribbean
confirmed that we need to have passports.

From there we went into crisis mode.  We asked the gal that was
watching our pets to get into our documents and fax birth certificates
and passports to a bank in Seattle.  There an employee of the bank
was kind enough to notarize those copies.  We took those to embarkation
and after pulling in about a handful of other people they decided that
we were legit enough to get on the boat.  I haven't been that nervous
in a long time.  Even after we were on, we were just waiting for them
to call our name, sure that we were going to get escorted off the
boat.

This was the first cruise for the boys.  They had a lot of fun, although
an Alaskan Cruise probably isn't the most kid friendly cruise you can 
take.  Making our way to Juneau you travel in between islands skirting
the coast.  The waters are so calm, you're not out on the open ocean.  That
was different than the other cruises we've done in the Gulf of Mexico.

In Juneau we did a whale watching excursion.  It didn't fail to produce
some whale fins.  We saw lots of amazing wildlife and got close to a 
glacier.  The mountains are just huge in Alaska.

In Skagway we took a ride up to see sled dogs.  The boys had fun, it was
cool to see the dogs doing what they love.

For our last stop we went to Victoria, British Columbia.  It's a beautiful
city.  The tour took us to their Parliament building.

When we were coming back through customs I was all prepared to tell
the immigration guys our story.  They took a look at us and said we were
all obviously Americans and waved us off.
