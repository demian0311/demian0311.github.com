At [work](https://timewarnercable.com) they had us take the 
[Gallup StrengthsFinder](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com) test to see what our strengths 
are.  I figured they paid for it, why shouldn't the whole world benefit from knowing what my 
strengths are according to Gallup.

I don't imagine much will be done with this data but my co-workers and I compared our results 
and they were accurate.  Here they are in priority order.

## Learner
Indeed I like to learn.  Programming is a great career for someone who likes to learn.  I like to 
be pragmatic about it, learning what I need to get something done and do the right things.  

In my personal life I see the same thing.  I cycle through different things to study, right now it's 
amateur radio and a distant second of learning the guitar.  I don't read fiction because I'd rather
be learning stuff, sure there are great rebuttals to that statement.

The Gallup description says that sometimes for a learner the process is more significant than the
result.  I'd like to think that's not the case with me.  I believe I am more pragmatic and that I
get amped up about applying what I learn to solve problems.  That's when the payoff is.

## Strategic

Yeah this is me too.  I think about the long-term results of decisions and wether or not we will come
to regret them.  I have a strong pull to share these views.

## Achiever

The Gallup copy explains this strength as needing continual success.  This one fits as well.  I know
that I sometimes say 'we need a win' or 'they need a W on the board'.  If I'm being honest with myself,
this isn't all the time.  I need to be engaged and bought into what is happening.  I set goals for 
myself and I feel good about achieving them, peronsally and professionally.  

## Focus

I also hear myself say 'we need to make forward progress'.  So yeah this one is appropriate too.  When
I get my head wrapped around a problem I get a tight grip on it.

## Responsibility

I guess this fits as well.  As with 'achiever' I honestly need to be invested in the endeavor before I
attach that responsibility.  If something is out of my area or if there are other folks running with it
I do see myself not exercising this strength.
