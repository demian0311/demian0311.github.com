## Road Trip to Colorado 

We did a Summer road trip to Colorado and Utah.  Driving from Louisiana I wish that I could
fold the state of Texas, it's a big state.  

Our first stop off was in Colorado Springs.  When
we lived in Colorado we didn't go to Cave of the Winds.  I guess we still didn't go there
because we pretty much just stopped off and did tourist trap things.  Our original plan was
to go to the Great Sand Dunes but there were fires in the way of our plans.

Then we went to Glenwood Springs to do more tourist trap things.  We had fun.

After that West to Moab.  Moab always amazes, it's like being on another planet.  We did
some light rafting and took an off-road tour in a Jeep.

Back to Colorado we stopped off in Ouray, it's where Courtney and I got married.  That was
fun to check out.  We started down [Million Dollar Highway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfKBjf9SN9M&feature=youtu.be).  It
started to rain and hail so we turned around.  Later on we found out that some portions of the
road were washed out and there were cars stuck on the road unable to move past the debris 
caused by the heavy rain.  Glad we chickened out.  We've been to Ouray quite a few times and
we had never checked out Box Canyon.  On this trip we went over there, it was pretty cool, it's
worth it if you're already in Ouray.

Finally down to Boulder for Korean Barbecue, seeing friends and the world famous [Casa Bonita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAVZ5DZ_LtI).
