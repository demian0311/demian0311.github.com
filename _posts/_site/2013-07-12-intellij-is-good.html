<p>This seems to be a theme lately where I’m late to the party, taking a long time
to <em>get</em> something that is common knowledge to most folks.</p>

<h2 id="groovy--grails-support">Groovy / Grails Support</h2>
<p>I was beating my head against the wall using <a href="http://grails.org/products/ggts">GGTS</a>.
For example it was astonishing to me that GGTS didn’t understand that I should have a 
<a href="http://grails.org/doc/2.2.1/ref/Servlet%20API/request.html">request</a> available to me 
while working with Controllers.  No code completion, I was all on my own.  GGTS 
couldn’t help me out at all.  Man I hope it’s a PEBKAC problem but I couldn’t get it working.</p>

<p>So I bit the bullet and started evaluating the newest version of IntelliJ.  After meeting
some resistance<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> at work to justify the expense 
I decided to pay for a license out
of my own pocket.  That’s how good I think it has been for my productivity.</p>

<h2 id="scala-and-playframework-support">Scala and PlayFramework Support</h2>
<p>What I have done in my day job is use the <a href="http://scala-ide.org/">TypeSafe Scala IDE</a> 
for my Scala programming.  Really that wasn’t going too bad at all.  TypeSafe is 
dog-fooding it and they’re doing a pretty good job.</p>

<p>IntelliJ also has great support for Scala and the PlayFramework.  After hours I’m playing
with Play, no complaints there.</p>

<p>I haven’t fully pulled in our large Scala code-base at work quite yet.  We’ll see how that
goes, not expecting much trouble.</p>

<h2 id="productivity-boosters">Productivity Boosters</h2>
<p>One of the big things to re-map ⌘-R to re-run my last tests.  I do that in
Eclipse and it works out really good.  I’m a very proficient with the keyboard but
day to day the function keys are dead to me.</p>

<p>Another big thing that has been helpful is the <a href="http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164">IdeaVim</a>
plugin.  It’s 95% perfect for me.  I’m real quick to get around using it.  The last
5% that doesn’t work the way I want is really just indenting and outdenting a block
of text.  It doesn’t work the same way VIM does.  It’s great to be able to keep my
brain in VIM mode.</p>

<p>previously but I wanted them to pay for the latest version.</p>

      <p>It’s not quite as bad as it sounds, they paid for an older version of IntelliJ for me <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
