<p>This is just a collection of observations related to lifting right now.</p>

<h2 id="week-3-now-with-finishers">Week 3 now with Finishers</h2>

<h3 id="week-3">Week 3</h3>

<p>That is, week 3 of the 5/3/1 template.  Week 3 is when you lift the most that 
you’re going to lift that month.  The idea is that after week 3 you are going 
to take a rest (deload) for a week.  This seemed like a good time to throw in
finihsers.</p>

<h3 id="finishers">Finishers</h3>

<p>Finishers are ways of doing exercises at the end of a workout that are kind of
un-conventional.  Normal exercises are prescribed with sets and reps and you 
work through them.  Finishers are a-typical.  If you did them all the time you
might burn out but they are good to do occasionally to get results.</p>

<p>Traits of finishers</p>

<ul>
  <li>you do them at the end of your workout</li>
  <li>you do them intensely, nothing is left in the tank at the end</li>
  <li>it’s okay if form goes bad (as long as you’re safe)</li>
  <li>you do them rarely</li>
  <li>they are meant to give you a pump (hypertrophy is the goal)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of finishers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/hit-on-21s.html">21s</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/arms-exercises/explode-your-guns-biceps-blasting-method">I go, you go</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_set">Strip sets, drop sets or running the rack</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/andy2.htm">Super sets</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I’m doing 2 strip sets at the end of every workout for the 3rd week of 5/3/1.  I like 
it.  I don’t have it in my spreadsheet so I could see leaving it out if I’m not feeling it.</p>

<p>Here are the exercises I’m doing for each day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>press: thin grip bench</li>
  <li>dead: <a href="http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/OlympicLifts/RomanianDeadlift.html">RDL</a></li>
  <li>bench: curls (Sun’s out gun’s out)</li>
  <li>squat: front squat</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pull-up-bar-and-symmetry">Pull-Up Bar and Symmetry</h2>
<p>I bought a pull-up bar.  I got the <a href="http://www.studbarpullup.com/">Stud Bar</a>, seemed appropriate
for me.  One of the provided bolts snapped, I may have not drilled deep enough into the rafters.
Even with only 3 bolts in, the thing is solidly in place.  And the bar is thick.  I’m a tubby man
and the bar doesn’t bend at all.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7372/13778097534_6090451413_m.jpg" alt="perils" /></p>

<p>One bad thing about having pull-up bar is that my 7 year old son climbed up a rope I had hanging 
from it, fell down and broke his arm.  We did have some foam padding under the bar but obviously
it wasn’t enough to prevent that injury.  That entirely sucks and is squarely my fault.  But it’s a 
somewhat safe lesson in his own mortality that will serve him well.</p>

<p>I haven’t done pull-ups since I stopped working out at the local gym.  I was doing pull-ups 
in-between every pushing movement as prescribed by <a href="http://jimwendler.com/">Jim Wendler</a>.  So yeah
it’s been a year with no pull-ups.  I haven’t tried to see how many I can do.  I’m very conservative
when I introduce or re-introduce movements back into my routine.  So for now I’m just doing 1 
pull-up in-between each pushing movement on press and bench days.  Next month I think I’ll attempt 
2 pull-ups and see where that gets me.</p>

<p>What I did not expect is that it seems to have helped some lingering shoulder pain I have acquired.
I have been going pretty heavy (relatively for me) with the press.  My PR for the press is 205.
It just enforces the mantra that you should train with symmetry.  I was doing a lot of pushing in 
the vertical plane but no pulling in the vertical plane.</p>

<p>Doing pull-ups along with backing off the press weight a little bit has my shoulders doing <em>much</em>
better.</p>

<h2 id="iso-lateral">Iso-Lateral</h2>
<p>Speaking of backing off on the weight.  I have either stayed level with where my weights were
or in the case of the press I have come down a little bit.  It just seems that I need to not push
it quite as much as I have been.  When you take something away hopefully you’re adding something 
back that moves you forward or challenges you.  I think that’s what I’ve done.</p>

<p><a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Isolateral-Exercise---What-is-it-and-Why-is-it-Beneficial?-The-Answer-is-Here!&amp;id=2120443">Iso-lateral</a> means that you’re doing something favoring or just using one side of your body.  If 
you’re using a machine you can probably isolate things very well.  If you’re using other equipment
like a kettlebell, dumbell, landmine or pulley you can’t isolate things very well.  But that’s
not so bad because this imbalance causes all sorts of interesting muscles to engage to stabilize
and firm up your body so you can perform the exercise.  Really this is good stuff for the core
and will make for a more solid human.</p>

<p>I like the movements.  I feel like it’s kind of <em>shoring up</em> my strength.  Building a stronger base.
I was watching a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqy72fYwZdg&amp;t=2m23s">Mountain Athelete</a>.  They
train military people and mountaineers.  I believe he used the phrase <em>combat chasis</em>.  Really
from the chest to the knees, that area that is going to be carrying the load where you really want
to be strong.</p>

<p>Here are the iso-lateral movements I’m doing these days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>kettlebell snatch</li>
  <li>kettlebell suitcase deadlift</li>
  <li>kettlebell press</li>
  <li>landmine row</li>
  <li>kettlebell calf press</li>
  <li>kettlebell squat (not a goblet squat)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="re-set-the-bench">Re-set the Bench</h2>
<p>I did the math and figured out how low I could start on the bench, add 5 pounds a month and still
end up at benching 285 at the end of the year.  And that’s where I put my bench.  I still feel 
sub-optimal when I bench.  It’s an exercise that I kind of don’t have a lot of respect for and
I’m in no rush to see it go up.  It’s the typical meat-head barometer for how strong you are but
has little carry-over in the real world.  Unless you find yourself with your back firmly pressed
on a flat surface and a desire to press in a perpendicular direction to your back.</p>

<h2 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h2>
<p>My paleo-ish  <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=permabulker">perma-bulk</a> could
probably use some dialing back so here are some tweaks I have been making.</p>

<ul>
  <li>don’t go looking for food dairy but don’t avoid it, so no snacking on cheese, no more sour cream</li>
  <li>1 scoop of protein and 1 cup of milk post-workout (as opposed to 2 scoops and probably 2 cups)</li>
  <li>no half &amp; half in drinks after lunch, my morning coffee will always have half &amp; half I will die on that hill</li>
  <li>no snacking except for 3 brazil nuts and 2 90% Lindt squares before bed</li>
  <li>no breakfast on days I don’t lift</li>
  <li>low carb 6 days a week</li>
  <li>moderate carb 1 day a week</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-music">New Music</h2>

<p>My music was getting old.  I did the lazy thing and actually <em>bought</em> some music instead of 
working hard to pirate it.  I should spend 20 minutes to clean up the list below to remove all
the un-necessary information.  It’s especially in-excusable because I’m awesome at VIM.  But 
I’m still not going to do that.  This is what I get when I copy and paste my playlist from
iTunes.</p>

<p>You got your dubstep, old school rap, pop, new rap, metal.  It’s working for me.</p>
