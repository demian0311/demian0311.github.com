<p>This quote isn’t in the book, perhaps it was delivered too recent to make it in.  But it’s a great quote by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Stoic is someone who transforms fear into prudence, 
pain into transformation, 
mistakes into initiation, 
and desire into undertaking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first book on stoicism that I read was  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic/dp/0195374614">A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</a>.  In a sentence I’d say that it’s a 
gentle introduction to stoicism purposefully written from a modern perspective with a good amount
of history on the roots of stoicism.</p>

<p>The second book on stoicism that I more recently finished is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Obstacle-Is-Way-Timeless/dp/1591846358">The Obstacle is the Way</a> by Ryan Holiday.</p>

<p>The pattern seen throughout the book is to observe someone in business, military, politics or sport that has
done something that is an example of the stoic approach toward life.  It’s not always someone
who is a practicing stoic or who has read the stoics.  However the author does name notable people that
have read the stoics or claim that stoic thought has helped in their life, some of them are surprising.</p>

<p>It’s a good book to consider how stoicism has helped and can help people achieve great things and deal with
adversity.</p>
