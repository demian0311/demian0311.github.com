<p>I have been doing Scala and Groovy at the day job for about a year now.  For some side work I thought I’http://neidetcher.blogspot.comd use Java, there obviously aren’http://neidetcher.blogspot.comt enough semi-colons in my life.  I haven’http://neidetcher.blogspot.comt touched 1.7 yet and setting it up on my Mac wasn’http://neidetcher.blogspot.comt incredibly intuitive.</p>

<p>I had to do more poking around to arrive at this than I wish I had to.</p>

<p>Finding the actual download from Oracle is easy.</p>

<p>After installing Java 1.7 from Oracle I added this to my ~/.bashrc to actually use it.  Not sure if the install should’http://neidetcher.blogspot.comve done this or if I missed some steps I was supposed to take.</p>

<p>export JRE_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_10.jdk/Contents/Home/<br />
  export JAVA_HOME=$JRE_HOME<br />
  export JDK_HOME=$JRE_HOME<br />
  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH</p>

<p>And holy cow Oracle does not make it easy to find out how to download the JDK 1.7 API documentation.  Got to have it local for coding on an airplane.</p>
