<p>I pulled a toy Scala <a href="https://github.com/demian0311/scalakata">project</a> into Eclipse and saw this 
problem:</p>

<pre><code>IO error while decoding [file].scala with UTF-8 Please try specifying another one using the -encoding option
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://p5wscala.wordpress.com/tag/encoding/">This guy</a> didn’t have the exact solution but he got me pointed in the right direction.  The problem is that 
I must have copied in some non-UTF-8 characters into my source code.  At this point the Scala compiler
got confused.</p>

<p>Here’s a bunch of shell commands I did to fix the problem:</p>

<h3 id="figure-out-the-character-set-of-the-file-were-having-trouble-with">Figure out the character set of the file we’re having trouble with</h3>
<pre><code>~/code/scalakata&gt;file -I ./src/test/scala/com/neidetcher/sfti/Chapter1Test.scala
./src/test/scala/com/neidetcher/sfti/Chapter1Test.scala: text/x-java; charset=iso-8859-1 Yep, the old iso-8859-1, that's not what we want.  That's what we use as the *from* encoding.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="make-a-copy-of-the-offending-file-utf-8">Make a copy of the offending file UTF-8</h3>
<pre><code>~/code/scalakata&gt;iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 ./src/test/scala/com/neidetcher/sfti/Chapter1Test.scala &gt; ./src/test/scala/com/neidetcher/sfti/Chapter1Test.scala.utf8
</code></pre>

<h3 id="the-diff-command-will-show-you-what-the-offending-line-was">The diff command will show you what the offending line was</h3>
<pre><code>~/code/scalakata&gt;diff ./src/test/scala/com/neidetcher/sfti/Chapter1Test.scala ./src/test/scala/com/neidetcher/sfti/Chapter1Test.scala.utf8
134c134
&lt; 		// 4) Scala lets you multiply a string with a number?try out "crazy" * 3 in the REPL. What does this operation do? Where can you find it in Scaladoc?

</code></pre>

<h3 id="now-actually-replace-the-old-file">Now actually replace the old file</h3>
<pre><code>~/code/scalakata&gt;mv ./src/test/scala/com/neidetcher/sfti/Chapter1Test.scala.utf8 ./src/test/scala/com/neidetcher/sfti/Chapter1Test.scala
</code></pre>

<p>After that I was back in business.</p>
