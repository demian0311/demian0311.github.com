<p>This is our 3rd year of going to Pensacola Beach, Florida.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeE9oYN1OjY">Here’s the video of our 2014 trip</a>.
We usually do another trip besides this but this is our lazy trip, we set expectations very low.
We’ll go to the beach, go to the pool, take a nap, get something to eat.  The beaches are great
and it’s a 6 hour drive from home in Louisiana.</p>

<p>The water was more choppy than what I remember previously.  There were not jellyfish to zap us, mustn’t be
in season.  This is the first year that Bodhi can swim entirely on his own.  He’s a real strong swimmer.  When
last season ended he wasn’t quite there.  We got to the pool a lot early this Summer and he picked right
back up where he was and quickly got more confidence in swimming.</p>
