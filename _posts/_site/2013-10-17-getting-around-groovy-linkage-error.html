<h2 id="a-hystrix-grails-plugin">A Hystrix Grails Plugin</h2>
<p>I am trying my hand at <a href="https://github.com/demian0311/hystrix-circuit-breaker">creating a Grails plugin</a>
that will pull in the 
<a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">Netflix Hystrix circuit breaker</a> 
capability in your <a href="http://grails.org/">Grails</a> application.
I have never written Grails plugins before.  Holy cow writing Grails 
plugins is surprisingly straightforward.  It’s awesome.</p>

<p>Part of the reason I’m doing this is because we finally stumbled onto
the fact that using Grails plugins to manage your common code in an
enterprise is a good idea.  So we’re doing that at work.</p>

<p>I’m doing this with Netflix Hystrix because we use circuit breakers
at work in our Scala services.  Also, I am working on a talk to give in 2014 about
how to harden your application with respect to outgoing calls and the
concerns you should have with that.  Yes, I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern">circuit breakers</a>
are one of those concerns you should have.</p>

<p>Integrating the Hystrix into a Grails plugin has been fun and surprisingly easy.
The hooks that Grails gives you for hacking at the web.xml file are nice.  My 
problems began when I wanted to configure my newly created circuit breaker.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Groovy has a <a href="https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GROOVY-6286">known problem (Cannot call Java static method with same name as inner class (LinkageError))</a>.
It’s amusing that the author of that issue was attempting to do the
same thing I am; configure the Netflix Hystrix API.  I’m not sure how common 
it is to have a static method with the same name as an inner class.</p>

<p>The offending class is <a href="http://netflix.github.io/Hystrix/javadoc/com/netflix/hystrix/HystrixCommandProperties.html">HystrixCommandProperties</a>.
If you search that page for <em>Setter</em> you’ll see the inner class and 
the static factory method they want you to use to create a new one.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Groovy is the king of wild-ass options to call stuff so I thought 
I would try a bunch of different possibilities to see if they get me
around this issue.  I won’t show all the ways that didn’t work. 
Here’s the way that seems to work.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  static HystrixCommandProperties.Setter createHystrixCommandPropertiesSetter(){
      HystrixCommandProperties.invokeMethod("Setter", null)
  }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And <a href="https://github.com/demian0311/hystrix-circuit-breaker/blob/master/grails-app/controllers/hystrix/circuit/breaker/TestController.groovy">here’s a link to my silly example that proves the concept</a>.</p>
