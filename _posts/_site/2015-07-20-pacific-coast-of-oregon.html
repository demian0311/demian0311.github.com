<p>We did Florida for a week.  Then we were home in Louisiana for a couple weeks.  Then the whole family
took a trip to the Pacific Northwest to see the coast.</p>

<p>After flying into Portland we drove to Lincoln City.  Great access to the beach, the boys saw the Pacific 
Ocean for the first time.  We went to the <a href="http://aquarium.org/">Oregon Coast Aquarium</a> in Newport.  Then 
we went whale watching.  We saw whales come up for air but we didn’t see any tails.  The Pacific was choppy.</p>

<p>Then we set off for Cannon Beach.  On the way we went to the <a href="https://www.tillamook.com/">Tilamook Cheese Factory</a>.  We 
got to see how cheese was made and sampled some.  Not a destination you’d want to migrate to but it was on the way.  On to
Cannon Beach, this is where you can get to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haystack_Rock">Haystack Rock</a>.  It’s a very iconic, huge rock
sticking out of the beach.  It’s very picturesque but pictures don’t do it justice.  While we were there we 
saw a rescue.  I included it in the home video.</p>

<p>After that we went to Astoria.  That’s where <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089218/">The Goonies</a> was 
filmed.  We walked to the house featured in the movie and Bodhi did the truffle shuffle.  It’s a 
quaint sea side town that time forgot.  It also has <a href="http://www.crmm.org/">The Columbia River Maritime Museum</a>, we 
learned about shipping, boats and what the Coast Guard does.  We were able to tour a retired Coast Guard vessel
that was used to just be a light-house off the coast.  That’d be some boring duty.</p>
