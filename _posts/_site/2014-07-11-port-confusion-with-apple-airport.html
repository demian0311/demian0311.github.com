<p>This won’t add anything to the knowledge that <a href="http://blog.nephtaliproject.com/?p=129">already exists online</a> but 
hopefully it’s more searchable for the next poor sap that is confused by this.</p>

<h2 id="locking-down-my-server">Locking Down my Server</h2>

<p><a href="http://neidetcher.com">This site</a> runs on a tiny <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> server.  I’m no expert but 
one of the easiest things you can do to lock down your server is to shut down as many ports as possible.  That 
means that you don’t have potentially vulnerable software listening in on ports.</p>

<p>You’ll probably do some <code class="highlighter-rouge">nmap</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>demian@raven ~&gt;nmap localhost

Starting Nmap 5.00 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2014-07-11 09:51 CDT
Interesting ports on localhost (127.0.0.1):

443/tcp open  https

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.10 seconds
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And maybe some <code class="highlighter-rouge">netstat</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>demian@raven ~&gt;netstat -l

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I checked it locally and noticed that <code class="highlighter-rouge">exim4</code> was running and had a port open.  So I made sure that service was no
longer in the startup scripts and <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Daemon">removed the daemon</a>.</p>

<h2 id="now-try-from-laptop">Now Try from Laptop</h2>

<p>Just to be sure I ran it from <code class="highlighter-rouge">nmap</code> from my laptop.  This is what I saw.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>demian  ~  nmap neidetcher.com

</div>

<p>Whoah, that’s a lot of ports.  Obviously some hacker syndicate from Eastern Europe has replaced my version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">nmap</code>
such that it doesn’t show the ports they have used to turn my server into a slave for 
their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet">botnet</a>.</p>

<h2 id="apple-airport">Apple Airport</h2>

<p>I ran across <a href="http://blog.nephtaliproject.com/?p=129">this blog post</a>.  The deal is that Apple Airport will 
try to proxy protocols for you.  Apparently it doesn’t bother to check with the far-end servers to see if the
port is even available.  So, to you on your computer behind an Apple router, <code class="highlighter-rouge">nmap</code> will think the port is hot.</p>
