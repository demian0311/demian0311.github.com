I wonder with my like-minded co-workers.  We all like to write Scala
code.  We like our current job but we know it might not last forever.
At our next job, it'd be *nice* if we could write Scala code.  But
how do we flag ourselves as engineers who like Scala but have no 
desire to use some of the more esoteric Scala features.  Even more
important how do we make sure that a prospective team isn't full of
Scala coders that insist on pushing the envelope at every turn.

Scala makes solving problems easier for me.  I can do things with less
code.  I can use some techniques to make my code easier to understand
and eliminate lots of duplication.

## Cursed

I couldn't disagree more with Erik Meijer in his recent
write-up, [The Curse of the Excluded Middle](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2611829).  Erik
says that just adding some functional programming features to a lanuguage is a bad idea. He 
asserts that we should be doing 100% immutable functional programming.  

## Scala: The Good Parts

I was happty to see ThoughtWorks call out [Scala, the good parts](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/#/languages-and-frameworks) as
technology they recommend people adopt.  I enjoy coding
in Scala, I hate reading the code of people that embrace
everything Scala has to offer.  Maybe some day I'll code
like that and I'll look down on people that aren't excited
about implicits or doing fancy stuff with types.

I think this is going to be an issue for Scala.  It'd even
be a good idea to offer compiler flags that would disable 
some of the harder to understand features.

## Pragmatism

For Scala to continue it's success it'll need to find the balance between the 
functional programming wonks and the pragmatic engineers that
get excited about adding business value in the code they write.
Alright, maybe there's some overlap in that Venn diagram but my
small sample size tells me that isn't the case.

A lot of engineers want to write software like [Yngwie Malmsteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yngwie_Malmsteen)
write music.  Every performance is a chance to [show technical](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS_IYe5JTZ4&t=0m34s) prowess.

I want to write Scala code like Gene Simmons writes music.  KISS
writes music that is effective simple but effective.
