## Summary of Qualifications

I solve shit doing stuff like:

- asking the question everyone else wants to ask
- drawing pictures
- getting guys that sit 10 feet away from each other to start talking
- writing shell scripts
- shelling into boxes and rocking and rolling
- writing Scala, Groovy or Java code in an IDE
- being honest as balls

## Skill
### Languages and APIs

- First paid gig was COBOL on the mainframe.  There does exist a number that
would have me coding in COBOL again but it's a high number.
- I also did some Python back in the day, I like it but I'm not competent in it anymore.
- I've been in the Java game since 1997.  Writing JDBC code inside JSP
scriptlets like a ninja back in the day.
- I dabbled in Groovy / Grails for a long time.  More recently I have focused on it.
- About half the time I do Scala right now.  It's awesome, programming is fun again.  But I'm a pragmatic Scala coder.
- I actually dig the shit out of a good service oriented architecture.  
- I like ReST, I have yet to do a real-world ivory-tower ReST API though.

### Platforms and Tools
- Tomcat, web servers, whatever the fuck.  I'm smart as shit and can figure it out.
- I prefer Debian based Linux distros.  I like Ubuntu.  First Linux distro was Slackware in 1998.  I've used most Linux distros in between except Gentoo, got no time for that silliness. 
- I've had accounts on pretty much every flavor of Unix. 
- VIM up Emacs down.  
- I like git but I'm not the guy in the office that you come ask git questions.
- In the past year I switched to IntelliJ, yeah I should've switched sooner, it's good sauce.

## Experience

### [Time Warner Cable](http://www.timewarnercable.com/) - Senior Engineer, Denver, CO (Oct 10 - present)


### [Dash Carrier Services](https://www.linkedin.com/company/646621?trk=tyah&trkInfo=tarId%3A1398094869496%2Ctas%3Adash%20carrier%20services%2Cidx%3A1-1-1) - Principal Architect, Denver, CO (Jun 07 - Oct 10)
Working at Dash was like camping; in-tents.  Imagine a scrappy startup on a shoe-string budget,
small team, no real OPS support but the domain is goe-spatial emergency call and normal VoIP
call traffic routing.  That includes all the inventory, billing, APIs for provisioning and a
UI for internal operators and customers to manage their service.  

Here was the stack:
- MySQL
- Java
- iBatis
- Spring up in everything
- CXF for ReST and SOAP

### [OpenLogic](http://www.openlogic.com/) - Senior Engineer, Broomfield, CO (Dec 06 - Jun 07)
This is the only time I've been fired.  It happened to be a few weeks after I told the 
technical leadership that their architecture was doomed.  I said it as respectfully as 
I could and not in front of other team members.  Yeah, open-source software is awesome
I hoped to work there and make the world a better place but the business model is 
primarily focused on spreading open-source FUD.  Buy me a glass of MacAllan 12 year, neat, and I'll 
talk your ear off about this shit-storm.
