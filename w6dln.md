I first got into amateur radio in January 2016.  I wrote 
[a blog post about how that went](/ham/2016/01/19/entering-amateur-radio.html).

## Goals

The idea of a pack portable radio along with solar power sounds interesting.  I'm not
sure how much that limits you.  Maybe effectively doing a lot of HF doesn't make sense
with those restrictions.

I'd also like to get into ARES.  The [local amateur radio club](http://www.w5ddl.org/) is 
starting up some [ARES](http://www.arrl.org/ares) capability.  The constraints of that 
are similar but you need more of a [go-box](https://www.google.com/search?q=ham+radio+go+box&espv=2&biw=1316&bih=778&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR-ePZj9nKAhWps4MKHT5uBQYQsAQIGw) 
as opposed to something purely pack portable.

## Gear

I have a few [Baofeng UV5R](http://www.baofengradio.com/en/ProShowcn.asp?ID=141) radios. 
They are the gateway radio into HAM radio.  As of right now anyways they are just 
[$25 on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/BaoFeng-UV-5R-Dual-Radio-Black/dp/B007H4VT7A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1454417746&sr=8-2&keywords=baofeng+uv5r).
That's a cheap way to get into the hobby.
