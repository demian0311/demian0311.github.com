I first got into amateur radio in January 2016.  I wrote 
[a blog post about how that went](/ham/2016/01/19/entering-amateur-radio.html).

## Goals

The idea of a pack portable radio along with solar power sounds interesting.  I'm not
sure how much that limits you.  Maybe effectively doing a lot of HF doesn't make sense
with those restrictions.

I'd also like to get into ARES.  The [local amateur radio club](http://www.w5ddl.org/) is 
starting up some [ARES](http://www.arrl.org/ares) capability.  The constraints of that 
are similar but you need more of a [go-box](https://www.google.com/search?q=ham+radio+go+box&espv=2&biw=1316&bih=778&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR-ePZj9nKAhWps4MKHT5uBQYQsAQIGw) 
as opposed to something purely pack portable.

## Gear

### UHF/ VHF 
I have a few [Baofeng UV5R](http://www.baofengradio.com/en/ProShowcn.asp?ID=141) radios. 
They are the gateway radio into HAM radio.  As of right now anyways they are just 
[$25 on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/BaoFeng-UV-5R-Dual-Radio-Black/dp/B007H4VT7A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1454417746&sr=8-2&keywords=baofeng+uv5r).
That's a cheap way to get into the hobby.  

I got a couple antennas for the UV5Rs.  The [Nagoya NA-771 15.6-Inch Whip ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KC4PWQQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) makes
the radio work better while mobile.  And the [Tram 1185 Amateur Dual-Band Magnet Antenna](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045EQUBK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is good when
I'm not moving around.  Of course you can't stop there, you need a USB cable and extra batteries.

### HF

I finally got an [FT-817ND](http://www.yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&ProdCatID=102&encProdID=06014CD0AFA0702B25B12AB4DC9C0D27).  I
really was looking at an FT-857 but there was some supply disruption and I got impatient.  So I did what they 
tell all new HAMs not to do, start out with [QRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRP_operation).  I also got a
[Mini Buddipole](http://www.buddipole.com/minibuddipole.html).  My experience is limited to just a little bit of
20M listening.
