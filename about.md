I'm a software engineer, primarily working with JVM languages and in the telecommunications
domain.  Right now at work I do 80% Groovy, 20% Scala and after hours I do some Java8.

For the past few years I have been a remote worker.  The engineers I work with are all over
the country, technically the home office is Denver and I live in Lafayette, Louisiana.

Besides working I like to spend time with my family and resistance train.
