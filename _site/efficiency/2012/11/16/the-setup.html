    <h1>Neidetcher: The Setup</h1>

<p>One of my favorite blogs is <a href="http://usesthis.com/">The Setup</a>.  They feature various people that use computers in one way or another to do their job and simply ask them what their setup is.  Well since they haven&#39;t asked me what my setup is yet (not realizing that I&#39;m kind of a big deal) I&#39;m going to just post this on my own.  </p>

<h4>Who are you, and what do you do? I&#39;m a software engineer.  I have worked mostly for telecommunications companies.</h4>

<p>The most challenging job I had was leading up a small but capable development team responsible for routing phone calls, including geo-spatial 911 traffic.  This was at a startup without much support.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m a Senior Engineer at Time Warner Cable.  My home office is in Denver, Colorado but I work remote in Lafayette, Louisiana.  I fly back about once a month.  The team I&#39;m on works on the services that IP devices use to get streaming television content.  </p>

<h4>What hardware do you use? My main computer is a MacBookPro 15&quot; from 2010.  I also have a MacPro Desktop.  Each computer has a 27&quot; Thunderbolt Display.  I was skeptical at first but the Apple Magic Mouse is an amazing piece of equipment.  I use 1 standard keyboard for the desktop but primarily I use the bluetooth keyboard.  I wouldn&#39;t mind having the bigger size but the travel from home keys to the mouse seems like an eternity compared to the bluetooth keyboard.</h4>

<p>I also have an iPad 2 for work.  I use it to validate software releases, cable channel updates.  I also have an Asus Transformer to do the same thing on the Android platform.  I don&#39;t write the client code but the team I&#39;m on is responsible for many of the back end services that these devices talk to.</p>

<p>My phone is an LG P999 Android phone.  Works great, has all the apps I need; Evernote, Pandora, Dropbox, Google Reader.  </p>

<h4>And what software? I run MacOS on both machines.  The laptop is 10.6, the desktop is 10.7.  I hear so much griping about upgrading the OS that I don&#39;t mind waiting a while until the kinks get worked out.  Before going to the Mac a few years ago I was strictly a Linux user.  It has been a smooth transition to the Mac.  I still feel comfortable whenever I go back to Linux.  If Apple gets too stupid I&#39;ll probably switch back.</h4>

<p>I spend most of my time in the IDE.  I run <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> with the <a href="http://scala-ide.org/">Scala-IDE</a> plugin.  I also use a code coverage plugin for Eclipse that can handle Scala called <a href="https://github.com/jmhofer/eCobertura">eCobertura</a>.</p>

<p>Despite having an IDE I spend a lot of my time in the console, for that I use <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a>.  Being a long-time VIM user I&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>, it&#39;s a great distribution of VIM.  I use <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> for installing commandline tools that are missing from the Mac.  At work and in my personal development we use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> exclusively.  On my desktop I run <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> for continuous integration.  It polls the git repository on my laptop and our remote GitHub Enterprise servers at work.  It continuously compiles our code, runs tests and generates reports.</p>

<p>When using a browser for development I will typically use Chrome.  The Chrome plugins I use are for either maintaining privacy or doing software development.  I use Poster, Edit this Cookie, AdBlock, Chrome Nanny, Ghostery, Time Tracker, Evernote and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp">HTTPS Everywhere</a>.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.share-mouse.com/">ShareMouse</a> to make both computers and monitors feel like one big computer.  The price is right (free in my case) but it&#39;s occasionally glitchy.</p>

<p>For remote work these come in handy: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/time-zones/id448041594?mt=12">TimeZone</a>,  <a href="http://beta.skype.com/en/">Skype</a> and <a href="https://join.me/">join.me</a> for impromptu screen sharing</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> to keep track of information, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a> to sync files, Pomodoro on occasion to focus, <a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/">f.lux</a> to save my eyes when working after dark, <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> as an app launcher and searcher, <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a> for previewing MarkDown files. <a href="http://mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> to create mind maps, <a href="http://www.pandabarapp.com/">PandaBar</a> to make listening to Pandora radio not depend on Adobe Air (WTF) and <a href="https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt">ShiftIt</a> to easily organize windows.  </p>

<h4>What would be your dream setup? Pretty much my same setup but with more RAM.  Maybe some SSDs.  The Scala compiler does a lot of work for you so you need top end hardware when you&#39;re doing any Scala project that is beyond trivial.  Although our own informal analysis at work seems to indicate that SSDs don&#39;t buy you too much for building Scala code, seems that good old fashioned RAM and processor speed is what you need..</h4>

<p>Other than that I&#39;d like to have a screaming ThinkPad or AlienWare laptop running some <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> Linux variant.</p>
