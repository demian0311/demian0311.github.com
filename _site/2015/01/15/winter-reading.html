<h2>MONEY Master the Game - Tony Robbins</h2>

<p>I heard his interview on the <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">Tim Ferriss</a> podcast and
decided to read the book.  30% bragging about who he has helped, 30% building up what he&#39;s
going to tell you and then 30% on actual good, actionable personal financial advice.  Oh
also there is some cross-marketing of services that are promoted in the book that Tony 
Robbins I would assume benefits from.  It&#39;s not in your face but it&#39;s there.</p>

<p>The premise of the book is that he saw so many people get wiped out in 2008 that he&#39;s 
curious about what&#39;s going on and what the common man can do to not get screwed again.
To this end he is able to get an audience with a lot of high performing financial guys.
He interviews them and gets some good information.</p>

<p>The price of the book on Kindle was worth that 30%.  What I liked most was the allocations
that he gets.  The book has motivated to get more serious about retirement and allocations.
Otherwise, lots of sound advice.</p>

<h3>Some take aways</h3>

<ul>
<li>Just use low fee index funds that track the market in your 401k.</li>
<li>Set up an annual increase plan to automatically bump your partipation percentage.</li>
<li>His allocations split between US bonds, stocks, gold and commodities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zero to One - Peter Thiel</h2>

<p>Great book.  I found myself laughing a few times.  Peter Thiel is a highly successful 
entrepreneur and venture capitalist.  The book offers his perspective on what makes a 
good business from a lot of perspectives.  It challenges some conventional notions 
about what make good businesses.  The book also gives insight into how VCs operate and
evaluate companies they fund.</p>

<h3>Some take aways</h3>

<ul>
<li>The lionization of competition is not useful for business, a good business has a virtual monopoly.</li>
<li>Good founders are outliers and weirdos.</li>
<li>Good founders have a prior history. </li>
</ul>
