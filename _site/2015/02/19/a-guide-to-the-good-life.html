<p>Raise your hand if your job title is <em>I work with assholes all day</em>.  Wow, that was a lot, you might
want to read this book.  The full title of the book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic/dp/0195374614">A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</a>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I have read blog posts and perused Wikipedia but this is the first book I have read on stoicism.  It 
probably doesn&#39;t help that the word <em>Stoic</em> is used commonly to refer to someone who seems without
emotion.  But for the un-initiated, stoicism is a Greek and Roman philosophy that is concerned with
minimizing bad emotions.  It&#39;s different in that is very practical, it&#39;s not very abstract.  It&#39;s
better to think of it as a set of tools that help you navigate your day and your life with minimal
negative thoughts like jealousy, anxiety, anger and so on.</p>

<p>Like so many topics I think I gravitated towards this because instead of showing me something I 
never thought of before it more codifies an approach or ideology I already have.  There&#39;s a lot
of value in firming up your existing beliefs but it&#39;s good to be aware of the selection bias that
you have.</p>

<h2>The Book</h2>

<p>The book covers the history of stoicism.  That was interesting although some notable Stoics seemed
to die early.  That might not be encouraging when you&#39;re browsing for philosophies.</p>

<p>It goes on to cover some techniques to help you in your daily life.  The author doesn&#39;t hide the
fact that he is interpreting original Stoic literature for us and applying it to modern life.  It&#39;s 
not a big book, seems to be a great introduction overall to the philosophy.</p>

<h2>Some Techniques</h2>

<h3>Negative Visualization</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever reasoned <em>what is the worst that could happen</em> to get yourself through something then
you have practiced negative visualization.  For example if you have anxiety about entirely losing your
livelyhood you could imagine living with family.  Maybe that wouldn&#39;t be so bad, maybe you&#39;d connect
more than you would have otherwise.  Alright, perhaps a bad example but you get the idea.  There are
other variations on this theme but that&#39;s the gist.</p>

<h3>Dichotomy of Control</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever read the Serenity Prayer you&#39;re familiar with this Stoic principle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
The courage to change the things I can,
And the wisdom to know the difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s really about working through the things that you can absolutely control (the thoughts in your
mind), the things you sort of control (your actions) and the things you absolutely don&#39;t control which
is pretty much everything else in the world.  There&#39;s much more useful subtlety in the book.</p>

<h3>Fatalism for the Past</h3>

<p>Stoics also seem to practice a kind of fatalism on past events.  I guess this is just a function of
putting the past into the bucket of those things you can&#39;t control.  So let it guide your decisions
but don&#39;t dwell on it and don&#39;t worry about it.</p>

<h2>End Matter</h2>

<p>You might think that all this would make someone apathetic towards life.  That&#39;s not the case, 
Stoics seem to think you have a social duty based on your existence.  You should strive to be 
productive and have a positive influence on others.</p>

<p>Still not sure, go read <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius">some quotes from Marcus Aurelius</a>.  He was the last big Stoic, a Roman
Emporer and apparently an alright guy.  His job description including having to work with assholes
all day.  These guys had it figured out, it&#39;s cool something so old has a lot to offer in the 
present day.</p>
