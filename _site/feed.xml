        <title>Lifting In 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just checking in here to talk about what&amp;#39;s working for me currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;walking between workout days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tracking accessory work in notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incorporating the incline bench&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upper-body 5/3/1 goals are about maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower-body 5/3/1 goals are about getting back to my modest peaks &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;still doing 5/3/1 so beginning of workouts look like power-lifting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upper-body finishing work looks like bodybuilding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower-body finishing work looks like conditioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stepping Back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in 2016 I felt a tweak in my back when doing the dead.  It wasn&amp;#39;t much
but I immediately took a week off and dropped my weights.  I also stopped using
a belt.  I don&amp;#39;t compete, I don&amp;#39;t have huge goals I just want to stay strong.  I&amp;#39;d
rather deadlift 225 at 70 than get impressive numbers in my 40s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What I do Now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://jimwendler.com/collections/books-programs/products/5-3-1-second-edition-hard-copy&quot;&gt;5/3/1&lt;/a&gt; with 
some modifications of course.  I entirely threw out the deload week of 5/3/1, the 
rest of the work outs are spread across the month.  This gives me good recovery time,
probably an important thing as I get older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Better Training Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure out how I want to progess over the year for the main lifts for 5/3/1. I 
have it in a single page spreadsheet for the whole year.  Each workout checks this 
off.  But I wasn&amp;#39;t tracking any of the rest of my accessory lifts.  I ended up in 
a situation where I added way too much weight for a tricep pull-over.  I was able
to do the lift but my connective tissue wasn&amp;#39;t ready.  This didn&amp;#39;t manifest as 
some lack of mobility but I was aware of it and I knew I messed up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/misc/training_log.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then
I started tracking everything I do each workout so that I can make sure that
accessory lifts advance in a sensible way.  I think this has been important
especially because I&amp;#39;m frankly holding back on my 5/3/1 lifts, playing the long
game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Walks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On days that I don&amp;#39;t lift I go for a half-hour walk.  It&amp;#39;s been good to keep the
routine going, good time to zone out before the work day and listen to a podcast.  If
it&amp;#39;s the weekend and we have other plans I bail on this without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sun:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mon: press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tue: walk &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wed: dead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thu: walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fri: bench&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sat: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sun: squat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mon: walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Upper-body Days&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being 5/3/1, the first sets are about the 5/3/1 sets.  It&amp;#39;s power-lifting focused, it&amp;#39;s
programmed and it&amp;#39;s what I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to hit for the day.  Everything else is up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think of the upper-body days as alternating between the vertical plane for the press
and the horizontal plane for the bench.  So I make sure that I am doing compound pull 
movements that complement the push movements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of upper-body days I train like a bodybuilder.  It&amp;#39;s about vanity and trying to
look good in a t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Press&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did get my press up to 205.  I can do it but it&amp;#39;s scary putting that much up.  It feels
like I&amp;#39;m pushing my luck or risking an injury.  For this year I have my maxes for press
down to 185.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 5/3/1 press sets I do an incline thin-grip bench.  Being incline it involves the 
delts more than a bench would and it&amp;#39;s a good compound movement to get the triceps going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For press days I obviously hit the delts hard.  I think the best thing I do for delts is
light dumbell work.  I do sets of 10, 8 and 6 reps with 21 pounds, then another
set of 10, 8 and 6 for 19 pounds then another for 17 pounds.  Note that for the front-raise
I do 10 reps in total, not 10 reps each shoulder.  The front delts get plenty of work already
from doing compound movements like the overhead press, benching and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go on a tangent here, barbell work is optimal for growing a solid base, it&amp;#39;s your
meat and potatoes.  I think it&amp;#39;s difficult to really get your shoulders to pop with 
just the barbell.  Since I started more serious dumbell work on the shoulders I have 
noticed that my shoulders and delts have responded well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.exrx.net/AnimatedEx/DeltoidPosterior/DBRearLateralRaise.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.exrx.net/AnimatedEx/DeltoidLateral/DBLateralRaise.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.exrx.net/AnimatedEx/DeltoidAnterior/DBAlternatingFrontRaise.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press day is also tricep day.  I do a tricep pull-over that I consider to be a pull
movement as well.  Yep a tricep movement that I consider a pull, nuts huh?  It hits 
the lats as well as the triceps.  I do it almost like Mark Rippetoe explains but 
I go farther back, the plates touch the floor at the bottom of the motion.  It&amp;#39;s 
a good stretch.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; 
    src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rh3MHnRI_I&quot; 
    frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    

&lt;p&gt;Recently I have also added single-joint dumbell work to finish off the triceps at the
end of the workout.  The single-joint, bodybuilding stuff goes at the end and is very optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bench&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bench is particularly low, I have it at 275 right now and my goal for the end of the year
is to be at 275.  I just don&amp;#39;t care to improve on it.  It seems like pushing the bench is a
great opportunity for injury.  I know it&amp;#39;s a common theme but I&amp;#39;d rather bench 225 at 70 than
push 315 at 46.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have however gotten more serious about upping the weights for dumbell press and incline
dumbell press.  These feel good, the range of motion and flexibility in position makes me
think I&amp;#39;m less likely to injure myself using those lifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incline bench is new.  Since I haven&amp;#39;t done an incline dumbell press in years I started
really low and I&amp;#39;m going to ramp up very gradually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On bench day I do biceps as well.  This is the bro-lifting day.  I was doing curl-bar curls
and I felt funkiness at the insertion point at the bottom of my bicep.  Now I do dumbell
curls and it feels a lot better.  I might do regular dumbell curls and/ or hammer curls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leg Days&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On lower-body days I alternate my 5/3/1 sets with some form of sit-up.  I&amp;#39;ll either do leg 
raises on a bench or sit-ups on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roguefitness.com/abmat&quot;&gt;abmat&lt;/a&gt;.  The world 
will never see my abs but I think sit-ups help keep the core together for squats.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 5/3/1 sets I might do 1 additional assistance exercise to help out with strength or
hypertrophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the tail end of my upper-body days I work out like a bodybuilder, to finish my 
lower-body days I work out like a cross-fitter.  Albeit a remedial, out of shape cross-fitter.
This conditioning work uses kettlebells, jump rope and the medicine ball come into play.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll do 3 rounds of something like this going &lt;a href=&quot;http://boxlifemagazine.com/benefits-of-the-emom-every-minute-on-the-minute-workout/&quot;&gt;every minute on the minute&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;exercise      | reps
--------------|-----
KB swing #70  | 20
KB snatch #35 | 20
jump rope     | 20
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe something like this but I take a 10 breath rest between exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;exercise        | reps
----------------|-----
KB snatch #53   | 10
KB swing #70    | 10
KB goblet squat | 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the assistance exercise I usually do either a barbell hip-thrust or the sumo deadlift.  For the
sumo deadlift I kind of do like a romanian deadlift, feeling the stretch at the bottom, touch and
go.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Squat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d really like to get my squat back up to 315 this year.  Accessory has been more squats, doing
a light load (currently ~155) for 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 reps with 10 breath pause in between sets.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Amateur Extra</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A year ago &lt;a href=&quot;/ham/2016/01/19/entering-amateur-radio.html&quot;&gt;I wrote about getting my first HAM licenses&lt;/a&gt;.  I
got the Technician license which lets you use frequencies suitable for local
use.  At the same time I tested for General which opens up the HF frequencies 
that let you communicate around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My assigned call-sign was lame so quickly I went up on the FCC website
to try to get a vanity call-sign.  I was able to get &lt;a href=&quot;/w6dln.html&quot;&gt;W6DLN&lt;/a&gt;. Ryder
got a technician license and we hooked him up with W8RAN.  I didn&amp;#39;t
want to do something more creative than just using initials of our names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Louisiana_floods&quot;&gt;epic flooding last year in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;.  Local
HAMs were able to help the Red Cross in Lafayette communicate with Baton Rouge and New Orleans because
cell towers to our East were in bad shape from the flooding.  I did a little bit of time for that and 
found it very rewarding to help out the community in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end I have been getting involved in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arrl.org/ares&quot;&gt;ARES&lt;/a&gt; group in the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w5ddl.org/&quot;&gt;local HAM club&lt;/a&gt;.  Being a General licensee is good enough to participate
but I wanted to get Amateur Extra before I started down the path of learning more about emergency
operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Studying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed mostly the same procedure for testing as I did before.  This 
time around I didn&amp;#39;t make the same mistake of peaking too early.  I peaked at just
about the right time.  I wasn&amp;#39;t consistently passing until the week before the test.
Then it was just about maintaining and focusing on a few things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To review, here&amp;#39;s what I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I first read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arrl.org/shop/ARRL-Extra-Class-License-Manual-11th-Edition/&quot;&gt;ARRL Extra Class License Manual 11th Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I Watched a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dcasler.com/ham-radio/extra/&quot;&gt;KE0OG&amp;#39;s videos on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I Read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w5yi.org/catalog_details.php?pid=65&quot;&gt;Gordon West Extra Class Study Manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally finished up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://hamstudy.org/&quot;&gt;hamstudy.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say going through all those steps things didn&amp;#39;t click right away.  I think it&amp;#39;s more about
absorbing the information from different angles as best you can.  If I&amp;#39;m being honest from there I went
about just cramming and memorizing on hamstudy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our club Volunteer Examiners are a great bunch of gentlemen; very positive and welcoming.  You study the 
entire question pool of 702 questions and when you take the test you have to answer 50 of those with a 
percentage of 75% or more to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed I did pass.  I got a rough set of questions, I wasn&amp;#39;t confident that I was going to make it, there
was a lot of head shaking and sighing as I filled out my answers.  I even brought enough money to attempt 
to take the test again.  For each attempt you have to pay $15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#39;s Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I&amp;#39;d like to pick up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mtcradio.com/yaesu-ft-857d-all-mode-hf-vhf-uhf-6m-mobile-transceiver/&quot;&gt;Yaesu FT-857D&lt;/a&gt;.
That model is capable, the user interface suffers because it&amp;#39;s very portable.  It&amp;#39;s ideal for being mobile in
the field. I have been listening on HF with the Yaesu FT-817.  Being low powered at 5 watts my voice is too 
faint to make many contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also like to start taking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.fema.gov/nims/&quot;&gt;FEMA classes&lt;/a&gt; so that I could be 
more useful in an emergency.  Right now the FEMA site is painful to register on, looks like that will
be an ordeal on it&amp;#39;s own.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2016 In Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Neidetcher family had a great 2016.  I put together a video.  I aspire to create yearly family review videos 
on the level of what my home-skillet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E64Bkt8L7oU&quot;&gt;Tim Berglund&lt;/a&gt; pumps out.  For 
now I&amp;#39;ll punt with the audio commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; 
src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/R3aIrZwCli4&quot; 
frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mardi Gras&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were able to attend a couple Mardi Gras balls in Baton Rouge at the invitation of some friends.  We also 
went to local Mardi Gras parades.  For those not in the Louisiana area Mardi Gras parades are plenty of fun but
they are more of a family event than the debauchery you find in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pensacola&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to Pensacola a whopping 3 times this year.  We&amp;#39;ll probably dial it back but we had fun every time.  It takes
about 5 hours to drive there, the beaches are awesome and the setup suits us perfectly.  The boys have an expectation
that a typical day will involve a breakfast buffet, morning at the beach, lunch, maybe a nap, then time at the pool
and then some dinner.  This is the first year we took the flashlights out to look for crabs at night.  Bodhi wasn&amp;#39;t
excited to realize you&amp;#39;re surrounded by crabs in the sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Pool&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added a pool to our back yard.  It&amp;#39;s medium sized.  We have a good amount of concrete around the pool, plenty of area
to entertain and generally walk around without shoes.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Caden &amp;amp; Mom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My oldest son Caden was able to come out to Louisiana from Oregon.  We were also able to get my mom down from Illinois. 
We went to Avery Island to see the Tabasco factory and check out the wild life.  He tried a lot of local food.  We used
our pool and made a trip to the firing range.  Courtney&amp;#39;s dad, Allen, took us for a boat ride in the Atchafalaya Basin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryder and Bodhi both did Spring and Fall baseball.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bodhi started the year in gymnastics.   We lucked out in that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.headkicks.com/&quot;&gt;Headkicks&lt;/a&gt;, a martial-arts school 
opened up very close to our house.  So the boys both enrolled in BJJ and Judo.  They both are having a great 
time.  Ryder may get more serious with it, Bodhi might peel off to do baseball. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryder and Bodhi have been going to piano lessons on Mondays.  Bodhi might be a little young for the piano so in the
coming year we&amp;#39;ll try the drums.  Ryder enjoys the piano though.  At the end of the year he had a little recital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scouting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Bodhi&amp;#39;s first year as a Cub Scout.  He&amp;#39;s a Tiger and Courtney is the den mom.  Both of the boys have a great
time with scouting.  It&amp;#39;s a good activity that forces us to do things we wouldn&amp;#39;t otherwise do.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryder and I went to a primitive fire making class on our own.  It rained the night before the class so it was 
challenging.  Some other people in the class were able to create fire but we just got some smoke.  Besides just 
the fire-making we got a good appreciation for how to use a knife in working wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cruise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Courtney and I did our first cruise.  We left from Galveston about 3 hours from our home in Lafayette.  The first stop
was Honduras.  We got over to a private beach, got some local food and checked out some animals.  From there it was
Belize.  There we went to a &lt;em&gt;very small&lt;/em&gt; private island to do some snorkeling.  The last port was Cozumel Mexico where
we toured some ruins and went to a beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fun just to see what it was all about.  The ship is like being at a casino.  There are lots of restaurants and
things to do.  We went to lots of shows which were more awesome than I thought they would be.  I had some slight
sea sickness.  The motion is good when you&amp;#39;re trying to sleep, it was liked being rocked in a cradle.  For about a 
week after the cruise I still felt like I was walking on the ship.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Orleans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Christmas we went to New Orleans to see a production of &lt;em&gt;The Grinch&lt;/em&gt;.  We took the trolley from downtown to 
the Audobon Zoo.  We had fun at the zoo.   &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Book Review Smarter Faster Better</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Faster-Better-Productive-Business/dp/081299339X&quot;&gt;Smarter Faster Better&lt;/a&gt; by 
Charles Duhigg ended up on my Amazon wish list.  Perhaps it was because one of the first stories in the book deal
with Marines and new approaches they are taking to get recruits motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 7 chapters and they all go into something that&amp;#39;ll make you better in some manner.  The formula for each
chapter interleaves a couple stories, culminating in an actual concept that can improve your performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;motivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;goal setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;managing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decision making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Marine story deals with motivation and &lt;em&gt;locus of control&lt;/em&gt;.  The concept is that if you think control of your life is within 
you (as in you are responsible for your life) then you are likely to be more motivated.  That makes sense,
if you have a fatalistic attitude and life is more something that happens to you then you&amp;#39;re less likely to do
something about it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book also references lean and agile concepts borrowed from manufacturing and software engineering.  The stories
in that chapter came together particularly well.  An FBI software project was saved by using lean practices and
agents in the field used that software to solved a kidnapping.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same chapter that dealt with agile also talked about commitment culture with respect to management.  He describes
a big study during the dot-com era in Silicon Valley that evaluated different company cultures.  The results indicated that a 
&lt;em&gt;commitment culture&lt;/em&gt;, this is a company where the leadership puts the welfare of employees as a high priority, do
better more consistently than other scenarios.  The probably reason is low turnover means less intellectual
property walking out the door, less expense in training people.  Those teams also built up a lot of trust that
enabled collaboration and general healthy environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book was good.  Not all of the ideas are shocking but it&amp;#39;s good to firm up the concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Book Review How To Fail At Almost Everything</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Loss Leader Pays Off&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say with the current election season I am drawn to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.dilbert.com/&quot;&gt;writing of Scott Adams&lt;/a&gt;.  He seems
to be one of the few people that has insight into the persuasion tactics that Trump employs.  Since 
he plugs his book in every blog post I finally relented and decided to read his book 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4&quot;&gt;How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Overall Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is a lot of anecdotes in the life of Scott Adams.  It reads like a funny older dude trying to drop
knowledge bombs on someone younger than him.  He covers everything from being successful to what makes up a
good diet.  Some of his stories get a little drawn out like he goes to great lengths and takes many chapters
talking about some issues he had with his voice while speaking.  I&amp;#39;m not sure I took much away from that.  But
he&amp;#39;s a funny guy and it comes through in the book. He talks about a lot of his failures and how those 
ultimately led to him being a success.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#39;ll know if you read his blog posts, Scott Adams has had some training in hypnosis and persuasion.  I 
have to say I get the impression I&amp;#39;m being gamed a bit when I read his writing.  All in all it&amp;#39;s a good book
if you like his style of writing then give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nuggets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like his assertion that goals are not good and that systems are a better approach.  He probably should just
use the word &lt;em&gt;habit&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt; but that doesn&amp;#39;t sound as cool.  When you set goals you find yourself
almost always being in a state of not meeting your goals.  Then &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you achieve your goal you set another one
and again, you&amp;#39;re in a state of being pre-goal.  It makes sense.  He prefers that you introduce habits into 
your life that will help you achieve goals that you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like instead of some goal of getting in shape you should try to walk 5 times a week.  This reminds me of what
has become known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret&quot;&gt;Seinfeld approach&lt;/a&gt;.  The
idea is that if he would write new jokes every day then he thought he could get better.  So he bought a big
wall calendar and every day he wrote a joke he drew a red X on the calendar.  When he had a few days in a row
he would feel compelled to keep it going.  It&amp;#39;s a neat idea, instead of having a goal of &amp;quot;write lots of jokes&amp;quot;, 
he introduced a practice, a habit or a system that would move him towards that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I do like is his focus on fitness, nutrition and taking care of yourself.  Sometimes generosity prevents
us from taking care of ourselves.  He says you should be more selfish in that regard, that way you can do the
things you want to do, be with people who are important to you and be more generous in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He points out that the more skills you have then the better off you are.  Often times it&amp;#39;s better to be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; 
at multiple things than being the absolute best at one thing.  Like what if you&amp;#39;re good at programming and you&amp;#39;re
good at understanding human psychology.  Or what if you&amp;#39;re good at writing but also speaking.  You can understand
how the addition of those skills might help you find a niche better than being the absolute best at one skill.  It&amp;#39;s 
an interesting idea to consider.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 21, &lt;em&gt;The Math of Success&lt;/em&gt; he talks about skills that he thinks are important for most anyone.  It&amp;#39;s 
good to think about.  But you also have to know that this is one guy talking about what has worked for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public Speaking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business Writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accounting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;and many more...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, good book, easy read, I recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Uberconf 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://uberconf.com&quot;&gt;UberConf&lt;/a&gt; 2016.  As always Jay Zimmerman puts on a great show.  As great
as UberConf is, it&amp;#39;s probably a conference you can get to every other year.  Lots of familiar speakers, they&amp;#39;re
all great.  I was surprised to see so few people I know in attendance.  Maybe people come to their senses and
get into management and I&amp;#39;m still slinging code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reactive Programming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the all day workshop on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/&quot;&gt;reactive programming&lt;/a&gt; given 
by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agiledeveloper.com/&quot;&gt;Venkat&lt;/a&gt;.  It gave me a good basis for reactive programming. 
Venkat gave an entertaining presentation as always and he covered a lot of ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hangup would be that he focused on the idea of streams or data-flow computing.  He gave examples like stock data 
or telemetry data continually streaming into your application to be processed.  I&amp;#39;ve been coding 
professionally for almost 20 years and I have never been in a domain where that happens.  Honestly 
that kind of turned me off.  It&amp;#39;s not sexy but the fact is developers primarily create HTTP front-ends 
for either a persistence or some other back-end system.  From Venkat&amp;#39;s perspective if your app doesn&amp;#39;t
deal with streams of information then it&amp;#39;s not going to be of much use.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spring and Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently have become re-interested in Spring.  I used Scala for a few years and then Groovy/ Grails.  I
forgot how useful all the Spring frameworks were.  They have kept up with things and a lot of the battle 
of being productive is just being aware of what&amp;#39;s out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of by &lt;a href=&quot;http://habuma.com/&quot;&gt;Craig Walls&lt;/a&gt;, they were great.  The theme of Craig&amp;#39;s 
talks were centered around &lt;em&gt;cloud native&lt;/em&gt;.  I like the idea, the point is that there are some 
new tools and concerns we&amp;#39;ll need when going to the cloud.  It doesn&amp;#39;t mean that all this is 
exclusive just to the cloud.  There was mention of &lt;a href=&quot;http://12factor.net/&quot;&gt;12 Factor Application&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;ve
gone through it before, seems like it&amp;#39;s something I need to re-visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He covered a lot of things about Spring.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://spring.io/&quot;&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt; is so huge and frankly they 
do a so-so job of organizing, documenting, deprecating and communicating best practices.  There&amp;#39;s 
just so much it&amp;#39;s probably very hard for them to keep a handle on it.  My point is that it&amp;#39;s great to 
hear someone speak that is up to speed on the best practices, how everything is positioned and really
just letting you know what&amp;#39;s out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also went to a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattstine.com/&quot;&gt;Matt Stine&lt;/a&gt; talks about microservices.  In covering
microservices he also touched on Spring frameworks that help you.  Matt also covered reactive programming
in a more pragmatic way such that I could imagine using it with real work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Netflix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/speaker/andrew_glover&quot;&gt;Andy Glover&lt;/a&gt; gave a keynote on 
Netflix.  I&amp;#39;m thankful for all the opensource software they have put out.  At my current work we
all looked like heroes just because we wired up &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix&quot;&gt;Hystrix circuit breakers&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That presentation went on about how great Netflix is, good on them, they&amp;#39;re doing amazing stuff.  But 
one thing that rubbed me wrong is how proud they are that they &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; hire senior engineers.  Is that a 
good thing if everyone just hires senior engineers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Docker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a 2 session Docker workshop.  There were a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people in attendance and any time you&amp;#39;re doing
virtualization with more than 100 people things go off the rails quick.  So &lt;a href=&quot;https://juddsolutions.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Chrisopher Judd&lt;/a&gt; 
had his work cut out for him.   I was glad I attended, for whatever reason I couldn&amp;#39;t fit some Docker concepts
into my head just from reading but the sessions were useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More Take-Aways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#39;s an interesting relationship with the cloud and microservices.  If you want to have microservices
you probably want to do cloud things to manage them even if you don&amp;#39;t use a cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spring and Netflix are doing great things, if you&amp;#39;re doing microservices or cloud stuff on the JVM you 
probably want to get familiar with the opensource tools they have available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to leverage Twitter&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://zipkin.io/&quot;&gt;Zipkin&lt;/a&gt; you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/&quot;&gt;Spring Cloud Sleuth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least right now it&amp;#39;s too soon for me to poke around with Java9 module capabilities.  It&amp;#39;ll be interesting
when there is build system and tooling support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Netflix &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/eureka&quot;&gt;Eureka&lt;/a&gt; for service discovery.  This prevents you from hard-coding
URLs to services your application depends on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Netflix &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/zuul&quot;&gt;Zuul&lt;/a&gt; to dynamically route services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zuul could be used to host static assets &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; be a gateway for services.  If you do this then you don&amp;#39;t have to 
worry about cross origin request concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix has an interesting approach to load balancing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon&quot;&gt;Ribbon&lt;/a&gt; runs on 
the client, is made aware of services by Eureka and does a sort of load balancing in the client.  There isn&amp;#39;t
a load balancer that sits in front of services.  So, the client using Ribbon will round-robin or lay off of
poorly behaving services for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config&quot;&gt;Spring Cloud Config&lt;/a&gt; to manage configuration in 
your cloud applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-elasticsearch-logstash-and-kibana-elk-stack-on-ubuntu-14-04&quot;&gt;ELK&lt;/a&gt;
seems to be the approach for distributed, searchable logging.  Seems like a bunch of work to get going, we use Splunk 
at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Book Review Lean Startup</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898&quot;&gt;Lean Startup&lt;/a&gt; for 
a while.  I didn&amp;#39;t know much about the book, you hear it recommended a lot and &lt;em&gt;lean&lt;/em&gt;, that&amp;#39;s good right?  The book is
good from my perspective as a software engineer, it provides some good perspective and a vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book&amp;#39;s main thesis is that a startup isn&amp;#39;t so much about &lt;em&gt;executing&lt;/em&gt; as it is about figuring out as quickly and
cheaply as possibly &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; the customer will actually want.  As an engineer we fall into the trap that if we build
this perfectly designed, scalable application using the latest technology then the effort is sure to be a winner.  The
author, Eric Ries, lays out how this isn&amp;#39;t helpful and gives lots of great examples to support his idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One concept I thought was great was the &lt;em&gt;concierge minimum viable product&lt;/em&gt;.  It doesn&amp;#39;t fit all startups but basically, 
if possible, you have humans do the work that computers would have done.  Like if it were Google Maps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll likely recognize the scenarios he describes or imagine where a business would have done better had it applied
some of the things Lean Startup suggests.  One thing that was funny is that as I read the book I thought about the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley&quot;&gt;HBO show Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.  As the last season wound down you would see them begin 
what will probably be a &lt;em&gt;zoom-in pivot&lt;/em&gt; towards a small feature they worked on in the hopes that focusing on that will 
support their venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;For the Software Engineer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is a good read for software engineers.  Lots of acknowledgement of good agile and lean practices.  There was
a good discussion of small batch sizes and why it&amp;#39;s good to release things in small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also favors a data-driven &lt;em&gt;metrics&lt;/em&gt; approach to understand if you are on the right track.  He goes into how tracking
the wrong data can be harmful, is sometimes goosed (again like in Silicon Valley) and too often the wrong data is left
to interpretation.  Lean Startup also talks about vanity metrics and gathering the right kind of metrics.  He favors
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_analysis&quot;&gt;cohort analysis&lt;/a&gt; but doesn&amp;#39;t go into much detail about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spring Security Grails Plugin Gotcha</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Spring Security Grails Plugin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, our hero is doing a Grails application and wants some security in a brand new Grails 3.1.6 
application.  Good thing there&amp;#39;s a plugin for that and I can move onto the next thing right away.  Oh
 you sweet summer child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the dependency in &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-groovy&quot; data-lang=&quot;groovy&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;compile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;org.grails.plugins:spring-security-core:3.1.1&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I run the associated script to create the domain objects that are going to manage the
security like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;grails s2-quickstart com.yourapp User Role --groupClassName=RoleGroup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blissfully ignorant and following along with the documentation I charged forward.  Next up 
you quick data for development to associate the user to the role in &lt;code&gt;BootStrap.groovy&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-groovy&quot; data-lang=&quot;groovy&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dneidetcher&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;username:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;dneidetcher&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;firstName:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Demian&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;lastName:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Neidetcher&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;emailAddress:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;demian0311@gmail.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;password:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;flush:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UserRole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dneidetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;adminRole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UserRole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;withSession&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;flush&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;clear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I apply my annotation on a controller so that I can allow access to it based on role:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-groovy&quot; data-lang=&quot;groovy&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;grails.plugin.springsecurity.annotation.Secured&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Secured&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;ROLE_ADMIN&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;UserController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scaffold&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Identifying the Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/user&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/user&lt;/a&gt; and you 
get &lt;em&gt;Sorry, you&amp;#39;re not authorized to view this page&lt;/em&gt; and nothing really more helpful than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out that our sad story really began when we added this &lt;code&gt;--groupClassName=RoleGroup&lt;/code&gt; to 
the &lt;code&gt;s2-quickstart&lt;/code&gt; command we used to generate the code.  The net of it is that my &lt;code&gt;BootStrap.groovy&lt;/code&gt; code
that associated &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Role&lt;/code&gt; was insufficient.  The group stuff wants you to associate a &lt;code&gt;Group&lt;/code&gt; with
a &lt;code&gt;Role&lt;/code&gt; and then a &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; with that &lt;code&gt;Group&lt;/code&gt; to get anything done.  That&amp;#39;s all fine but it&amp;#39;s a layer of
indirection I don&amp;#39;t think I need.  It took me over 3 hours to figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Fix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well in the first place I should have done this for my &lt;code&gt;s2-quickstart&lt;/code&gt; command.  That would have avoided the headache. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;grails s2-quickstart com.yourapp User Role 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in my case I wanted to attempt to back out of the mess so this is what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; you need to change this function to this implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-groovy&quot; data-lang=&quot;groovy&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getAuthorities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UserRole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findAllByUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)*.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;role&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;application.groovy&lt;/code&gt; you need to change this attribute to be false:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-groovy&quot; data-lang=&quot;groovy&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;springsecurity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;useRoleGroups&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you need to remove all of the Spring Security Plugin generated domain objects that have the word &lt;code&gt;Group&lt;/code&gt; 
in them.  After that things worked as expected, Spring Security worked with my annotations.  So yeah, maybe 
not so much a &lt;em&gt;gotcha&lt;/em&gt; but me not knowing Spring Security well enough.  Regardless, onward and upward.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Videos From This Spring</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Denver 2016&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past couple years I managed to get 2 snowboarding trips back to Denver.  This season I only got one.  Mike took his
daughter Chloe for lessons at Loveland so that&amp;#39;s where we went.  Visibility could&amp;#39;ve been better but I can&amp;#39;t complain. Work
flew a lot of people out so we could be in one place.  Enough of us were out such that our offices downtown Denver couldn&amp;#39;t
hold us all so we went over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.galvanize.com/&quot;&gt;Gavlanize&lt;/a&gt;.  It was great to see people, given the merger
not sure when or if I&amp;#39;ll get back there.  Holy cow Denver is growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fat Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mardi Gras in Lafayette, Louisiana is more about parades, Cajun food and family.  I&amp;#39;m sure you could stir up some
trouble but it&amp;#39;s a tame affair for most. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Strengths Finder</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://timewarnercable.com&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; they had us take the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com&quot;&gt;Gallup StrengthsFinder&lt;/a&gt; test to see what our strengths 
are.  I figured they paid for it, why shouldn&amp;#39;t the whole world benefit from knowing what my 
strengths are according to Gallup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t imagine much will be done with this data but my co-workers and I compared our results 
and they were accurate.  Here they are in priority order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Learner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed I like to learn.  Programming is a great career for someone who likes to learn.  I like to 
be pragmatic about it, learning what I need to get something done and do the right things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my personal life I see the same thing.  I cycle through different things to study, right now it&amp;#39;s 
amateur radio and a distant second of learning the guitar.  I don&amp;#39;t read fiction because I&amp;#39;d rather
be learning stuff, sure there are great rebuttals to that statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gallup description says that sometimes for a learner the process is more significant than the
result.  I&amp;#39;d like to think that&amp;#39;s not the case with me.  I believe I am more pragmatic and that I
get amped up about applying what I learn to solve problems.  That&amp;#39;s when the payoff is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Strategic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah this is me too.  I think about the long-term results of decisions and wether or not we will come
to regret them.  I have a strong pull to share these views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Achiever&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gallup copy explains this strength as needing continual success.  This one fits as well.  I know
that I sometimes say &amp;#39;we need a win&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;they need a W on the board&amp;#39;.  If I&amp;#39;m being honest with myself,
this isn&amp;#39;t all the time.  I need to be engaged and bought into what is happening.  I set goals for 
myself and I feel good about achieving them, peronsally and professionally.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Focus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also hear myself say &amp;#39;we need to make forward progress&amp;#39;.  So yeah this one is appropriate too.  When
I get my head wrapped around a problem I get a tight grip on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this fits as well.  As with &amp;#39;achiever&amp;#39; I honestly need to be invested in the endeavor before I
attach that responsibility.  If something is out of my area or if there are other folks running with it
I do see myself not exercising this strength.&lt;/p&gt;
