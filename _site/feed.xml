        <title>Hystrix Circuit Breaker With Java8</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll continue to be interesting to see what happens with Java8.  Sure the version is
out there, you can write all the lambdas you want.  But it&amp;#39;s going to get more fun
to see how every day coders use it and how library authors use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day I use Groovy, enjoy it&amp;#39;s closures.  I still do a bit of Scala but not as
much as I&amp;#39;d like.  But at night I&amp;#39;ve been working with Java8.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Generic Hystrix Circuit Breaker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I understand you should encapsulate the code that talks to remote systems 
inside of a class that implements a HystrixCommand.  I had a situation where there 
were a lot of little calls to a back-end system.  Creating new classes for each call 
was getting tedious.  So I endeavored to create a generic circuit breaker 
(implementation of HystrixCommand) for each dependent system.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just give it 2 suppliers, one for the actual thing you&amp;#39;re trying to do and another 
as a fallback if what you&amp;#39;re trying to do fails.  The suppliers have to adhere to the 
normal contract with circuit breakers.  If an exception bubbles up from one of your 
lambdas then the circuit breaker trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DatabaseCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HystrixCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Supplier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;runSupplier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Supplier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fallbackSupplier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DatabaseCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Supplier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;runSupplierIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Supplier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fallbackSupplierIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CommandProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getSetter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CommandProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;DB_COMMAND_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;runSupplier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;runSupplierIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fallbackSupplier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fallbackSupplierIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;runSupplier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getFallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fallbackSupplier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s some hand waving with the &lt;code&gt;CommandProvider.getSetter()&lt;/code&gt;, that&amp;#39;s the 
monster set of calls where you configure your circuit breaker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when you want to use the circuit breaker it looks something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DatabaseCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databaseCommand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DatabaseCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databaseClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findCustomer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databaseClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;findCustomerFromCache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;findCustomerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databaseCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t so bad.  Sure it&amp;#39;s convenient that I have those suppliers wrapped inside
of functions already so I don&amp;#39;t have nasty multi-line lambdas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Guide To The Good Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Raise your hand if your job title is &lt;em&gt;I work with assholes all day&lt;/em&gt;.  Wow, that was a lot, you might
want to read this book.  The full title of the book is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic/dp/0195374614&quot;&gt;A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have read blog posts and perused Wikipedia but this is the first book I have read on stoicism.  It 
probably doesn&amp;#39;t help that the word &lt;em&gt;Stoic&lt;/em&gt; is used commonly to refer to someone who seems without
emotion.  But for the un-initiated, stoicism is a Greek and Roman philosophy that is concerned with
minimizing bad emotions.  It&amp;#39;s different in that is very practical, it&amp;#39;s not very abstract.  It&amp;#39;s
better to think of it as a set of tools that help you navigate your day and your life with minimal
negative thoughts like jealousy, anxiety, anger and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like so many topics I think I gravitated towards this because instead of showing me something I 
never thought of before it more codifies an approach or ideology I already have.  There&amp;#39;s a lot
of value in firming up your existing beliefs but it&amp;#39;s good to be aware of the selection bias that
you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Book&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book covers the history of stoicism.  That was interesting although some notable Stoics seemed
to die early.  That might not be encouraging when you&amp;#39;re browsing for philosophies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes on to cover some techniques to help you in your daily life.  The author doesn&amp;#39;t hide the
fact that he is interpreting original Stoic literature for us and applying it to modern life.  It&amp;#39;s 
not a big book, seems to be a great introduction overall to the philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Negative Visualization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve ever reasoned &lt;em&gt;what is the worst that could happen&lt;/em&gt; to get yourself through something then
you have practiced negative visualization.  For example if you have anxiety about entirely losing your
livelyhood you could imagine living with family.  Maybe that wouldn&amp;#39;t be so bad, maybe you&amp;#39;d connect
more than you would have otherwise.  Alright, perhaps a bad example but you get the idea.  There are
other variations on this theme but that&amp;#39;s the gist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dichotomy of Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve ever read the Serenity Prayer you&amp;#39;re familiar with this Stoic principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
The courage to change the things I can,
And the wisdom to know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really about working through the things that you can absolutely control (the thoughts in your
mind), the things you sort of control (your actions) and the things you absolutely don&amp;#39;t control which
is pretty much everything else in the world.  There&amp;#39;s much more useful subtlety in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fatalism for the Past&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stoics also seem to practice a kind of fatalism on past events.  I guess this is just a function of
putting the past into the bucket of those things you can&amp;#39;t control.  So let it guide your decisions
but don&amp;#39;t dwell on it and don&amp;#39;t worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;End Matter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that all this would make someone apathetic towards life.  That&amp;#39;s not the case, 
Stoics seem to think you have a social duty based on your existence.  You should strive to be 
productive and have a positive influence on others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not sure, go read &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius&quot;&gt;some quotes from Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt;.  He was the last big Stoic, a Roman
Emporer and apparently an alright guy.  His job description including having to work with assholes
all day.  These guys had it figured out, it&amp;#39;s cool something so old has a lot to offer in the 
present day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Winter Reading</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;MONEY Master the Game - Tony Robbins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard his interview on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Tim Ferriss&lt;/a&gt; podcast and
decided to read the book.  30% bragging about who he has helped, 30% building up what he&amp;#39;s
going to tell you and then 30% on actual good, actionable personal financial advice.  Oh
also there is some cross-marketing of services that are promoted in the book that Tony 
Robbins I would assume benefits from.  It&amp;#39;s not in your face but it&amp;#39;s there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of the book is that he saw so many people get wiped out in 2008 that he&amp;#39;s 
curious about what&amp;#39;s going on and what the common man can do to not get screwed again.
To this end he is able to get an audience with a lot of high performing financial guys.
He interviews them and gets some good information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price of the book on Kindle was worth that 30%.  What I liked most was the allocations
that he gets.  The book has motivated to get more serious about retirement and allocations.
Otherwise, lots of sound advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Some take aways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just use low fee index funds that track the market in your 401k.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up an annual increase plan to automatically bump your partipation percentage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His allocations split between US bonds, stocks, gold and commodities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zero to One - Peter Thiel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great book.  I found myself laughing a few times.  Peter Thiel is a highly successful 
entrepreneur and venture capitalist.  The book offers his perspective on what makes a 
good business from a lot of perspectives.  It challenges some conventional notions 
about what make good businesses.  The book also gives insight into how VCs operate and
evaluate companies they fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Some take aways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lionization of competition is not useful for business, a good business has a virtual monopoly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good founders are outliers and should have a prior history. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be compelling, your offering should be a 10x improvement over your competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Lifting In 2014</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my PRs at the end of the year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press: 205&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dead: 365&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bench: 275&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squat: 315&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5/3/1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still trucking along on 5/3/1.  I think I&amp;#39;m going to stick with the template for this lifetime.
The undulation is probably good for someone that is getting older, being able to not go heavy
all of the time.  As I said last year, it&amp;#39;s a perfect mix of structure and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exercises&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Press&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a tweak in my shoulder while going heavy sometime mid-year so I lowered the weights and
decided to work back up to a 205 max.  Although my progress in the press has gone well I don&amp;#39;t 
feel the need to go any higher.  Of course 225 is calling but it&amp;#39;s an uneasy feeling to have 
205 pounds above your head, at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dead has stayed still for a year.  I&amp;#39;ve kept the weight at 365 for almost a year.  I think I
have more in the tank but it&amp;#39;s still slow to get up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue to be a fan of the barbell hip thrust.  I started at 65 pounds and after increasing the
weight by 5 pounds every workout I&amp;#39;m now doing 3 sets of 10 reps at 315 pounds.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bench&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To review what was wrong with my bench, I used a wide grip while trying to chase numbers.  It was
stupid.  Keeping a more narrow grip gives you more longevity so if you aren&amp;#39;t competing it just
makes sense.  Especially given the shoulder problems I have from dislocating my shoulder while
snowboarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I brought the numbers way down and worked up to a 275 single.  Like the other lifts, feels like
there&amp;#39;s more in the tank but now the game is being injury free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Squats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#39;t much you can do in the gym that is more of a head-trip than the squat.  It&amp;#39;s really 
the main lift where I have to summon the demons to prepare myself.  But as with the other lifts
I usually marvel at how easy it was to get up the weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On to 2015&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to keep the weight where it is but figure out a way to motivate myself such that getting
leaner is part of the picture.  I don&amp;#39;t want to switch to looking at scale weight and lose sight 
of strength numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that I want to maintain my strength and remain injury free.  I might dabble a little with
what would make up a minimal effective dose of training to stay where I&amp;#39;m at.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Java8 Fizz Buzz Revision 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my second attempt at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html&quot;&gt;FizzBuzz&lt;/a&gt; 
in &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdk8.java.net/download.html&quot;&gt;Java8&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/&quot;&gt;Lambdas&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first incarnation I did &lt;a href=&quot;/programming/2014/01/17/java8-fizz-buzz.html&quot;&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;#39;s more enterprisey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23674624/how-do-i-convert-a-java-8-intstream-to-a-list&quot;&gt;StackOverflow page&lt;/a&gt; is where I found out about &lt;code&gt;IntStream.boxed()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This thing is kind of a one liner.  Reminds me of how in Scala land a lot of things surprisingly end up being a single expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t a big fan of the ternary operator before getting into FP.  As you strive for more stateless coding you&amp;#39;ll find it&amp;#39;s your friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;neidetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;java8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.util.stream.IntStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FizzBuzz&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IntStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;boxed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Fizz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Buzz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

        <title>Gym Fouls</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My bubbly extrovert personality has me very happily working out at home the last couple
of years.  I love it, I have just the right amount of equipment and no one is ever on
the equipment I want to use.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before my critical tirade, I commend anyone that manages to get up the gumption to get to the
gym.  There was a long time where I couldn&amp;#39;t muster up that kind of motivation.  And anyone
that shows up in a given week is doing better than the folks that don&amp;#39;t even make an 
attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gym Fouls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the occasion to use a gym at a hotel on a recent trip and it reminded me of other 
reasons why I like to workout without people around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gym is not for reading.  Alright, maybe on the treadmill but you should only use the
treadmill if you need to get out of the house and you&amp;#39;re entire body is already sore from
resistance training.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training is a good time to focus on the movement you&amp;#39;re doing and to let your brain go 
on auto-pilot for a while.  Really this is a good thing for your brain and creativity.
Humans suck at multi-tasking, when you&amp;#39;re reading while training you are training crappy
and you&amp;#39;re reading crappy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Martial Arts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re getting your pump on, mirrors are everywhere and there are women in the gym.  What 
better time to whip on some next level kung-fu shit.  I really don&amp;#39;t need to make an 
argument against this just, no, please no.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Not Squatting in the Squat Rack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squat racks are for squatting.  Squats are the most important exercise a person can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual reason I quit going to my gym is because a guy was curling in the squat rack.
This is really bad.  But it gets worse, he was curling chains in the squat rack.  Chains
make sense if you are a geared power lifter and you want to load the lock-out of your 
bench or the top of your squat.  Chains are not for curling especially in the squat rack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Combo Moves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you know about lunges.  And you know about pressing 2 pound purple dumbells overhead. 
Obviously the combination of the two would be doubly beneficial.  Yeah, the best 
exercises are the ones that aren&amp;#39;t very creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ridiculous Movement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise machines are sub-optimal for whatever your fitness goals are but they&amp;#39;re 
easy.  Your butt goes on the seat, your hands go on the handles and then you exert 
in some prescribed manor.  So  usually you don&amp;#39;t see nonsensical movement on exercise 
machines.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You normally see this with dumbells.  But if the weight isn&amp;#39;t moving in something that
looks perpendicular to the surface of the Earth then you are probably doing things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variation of this is the deal where you put 1 dumbells in each hand and then lean over 
to one side or the other.  This is silly, you are providing counter weight, the most 
value you are getting out of this is just your traps and core supporting weight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably mean to do either a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Other/SBFarmersWalk.html&quot;&gt;farmers walk&lt;/a&gt; 
or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Obliques/DBSideBend.html&quot;&gt;weighted side bends&lt;/a&gt;.  Those 
are both good things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Not Having a Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I see, someone stumbles into the gym.  You see them look around surprised 
like they were just tele-ported to that location.  Next they&amp;#39;ll realise they should 
probably do something since they are there.  Sometimes they&amp;#39;ll just start reading 
(see above).  But hopefully they decide to do resistance training.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might see some inner conflict but usually this ends up ending up with &amp;quot;I should do
some curls&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;d be un-cool if I pointed out the wrong things people were doing and didn&amp;#39;t provide
any good things you could do in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Established Routines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stronglifts.com/&quot;&gt;StrongLifts&lt;/a&gt; is a legit program to start out with.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:The_Program&quot;&gt;Starting Strength&lt;/a&gt; is 
more popular and highly regarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t know how to do the exercises look on YouTube for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mark+rippetoe&quot;&gt;Mark Rippetoe&lt;/a&gt; or go to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exrx.net/Exercise.html&quot;&gt;exrx.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Starting Strength.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Workout A&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;exercise | sets | reps
---------|------|-----
squat    | 3    | 5
bench    | 3    | 5
deadlift | 1    | 5 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Workout B&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;exercise    | sets | reps
------------|------|-----
squat       | 3    | 5
press       | 3    | 5
power clean | 5    | 3 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Snowflake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a special snowflake and Starting Strength is too restrictive then just split 
workouts in some sensible fashion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;push/ pull/ legs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vertical / horizontal / legs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this guidance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 to 5 workouts in a week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 to 5 exercises in a workout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 to 5 sets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 to 10 reps per set (lower reps are for strength, more reps are for size)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prefer multi-joint movements and put them at the start of the workout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;single-joint (if any) movements at the end of the workout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fucking never skip leg day in the name of all that is holy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you should squat and your femur should go below parallel when you squat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;track your progress on the multi-joint movements you&amp;#39;re doing (press, deadlift, bench, squat)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start the weights very low low&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase the weights on &lt;em&gt;at least one&lt;/em&gt; exercise by 5 pounds each week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep showing up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>What Next For Java</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At Time Warner Cable we&amp;#39;re in the midst of an acquisition.  There is a possibility 
that many of us will be changing jobs in the coming years.  Since we&amp;#39;ve been at 
our current gig we have switched from using Java to Groovy and Scala.  A while ago, 
some fellow co-workers and I were talking about languages and where we think we&amp;#39;ll
end up and where we&amp;#39;d like to end up.  I thought this was an interesting conversation.
This sums up a lot of what was said, you can assume anything insightful wasn&amp;#39;t said
by me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Groovy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grails is great for bootstrapping a new project.  The architectural decisions have
been made for you and you just need to fill in the blanks with your  implementation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grails is great for working with web designers and UI people.  They can understand
how Grails works and it&amp;#39;s easy for them to work with the views.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s difficult to boldly refactor Groovy code though.  There&amp;#39;s a lot of magic going
on and the compiler or tests won&amp;#39;t always tell you when you&amp;#39;ve done something bad.
This is especially true when you inherit code with bad tests.  Often when attempting
a bold refactor I&amp;#39;ll need to lean on commandline searching to make sure there broken 
references that my IDE and compiler aren&amp;#39;t warning me about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, because Grails is so great Groovy or Grails are not going away any time 
soon.  I could see doing more Grails applications in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Greenfield&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if I were starting up a new team, would I pick it?  If we outsourced or had
a different team of UI/ UX web designers then having Grails on the front end is 
compelling at least for the web application.  But the looseness and lack of tooling
support would otherwise make me want to pick something with a more strict type 
system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scala&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Deep Water&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m mixed on Scala.  I&amp;#39;d like to throw away 30% of the features.  There are some 
features that make the code incredibly hard for me to understand.  I&amp;#39;m sure some
would say that those are the features that also make for very easy to use APIs.
Maybe the answer is something like CheckStyle that would bark at you if introduce 
new code to your project that is too hairy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Scala has really re-invigorated my enjoyment while programming.  It&amp;#39;s so powerful 
and functional programming let&amp;#39;s you do awesome code that just feels &lt;em&gt;tight&lt;/em&gt;.  We
just write some clean, awesome code that generally doesn&amp;#39;t have problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Asshole Magnet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scala seems like it could be a language for pedantic assholes to apply  esoteric 
features that make their code un-intelligible.  Whenever I code I try to imagine
me looking at this code a year from now, with a VP screaming on a conference call
at 3AM.  Would I be able to understand what I&amp;#39;m writing?  Could I safely change it?
If I need to bring to bear my entire intellect to write code I have no
hope of understanding it in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a big challenge for Scala going forward.  With Scala on my 
resume I&amp;#39;d like to somehow advertise to potential teams that I swing toward the 
more pragmatic side even though I&amp;#39;m using a language that attracts engineers
very interested in pushing Scala to the limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Greenfield&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d happily do more work in Scala.  But on a new team doing Scala I would 
really want to influence people to stay in the shallow end of the pool.  I&amp;#39;d 
also caution against throwing out all the great frameworks that the Java 
community has in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Java&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet we&amp;#39;ll see a renaissance in Java.  The language has amazing staying power. Relative 
to Groovy the tooling is so great for Java, you just totally know what
the code is doing.  It might be verbose and littered with semi-colons but you
get it.  It&amp;#39;s hard to hide your intentions in Java.  Maybe that&amp;#39;s just because
even though I haven&amp;#39;t done it much the last two years I&amp;#39;ve used the language for
a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lambdas, streams and the collections API are great.  They&amp;#39;ve done a great
job given the restrictions that they&amp;#39;re working under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Java coders aren&amp;#39;t going to get excited about lambdas for a while.  When 
popular libraries leverage these features then we&amp;#39;ll start to see lambdas embraced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Greenfield&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I found myself doing Java8 I&amp;#39;d embrace the new features and try to be as 
functional and immutable as possible.  The latest version of Spring leverages 
lambdas and it&amp;#39;d be fun to see where they (and other Java libraries) take it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;d also be interesting to loop back and see how you&amp;#39;d solve problems with the
new features.  For example with functional programming I bet annotations and aspect
oriented programming aren&amp;#39;t needed anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Port Confusion With Apple Airport</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This won&amp;#39;t add anything to the knowledge that &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nephtaliproject.com/?p=129&quot;&gt;already exists online&lt;/a&gt; but 
hopefully it&amp;#39;s more searchable for the next poor sap that is confused by this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Locking Down my Server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neidetcher.com&quot;&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; runs on a tiny &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rackspace.com/&quot;&gt;Rackspace&lt;/a&gt; server.  I&amp;#39;m no expert but 
one of the easiest things you can do to lock down your server is to shut down as many ports as possible.  That 
means that you don&amp;#39;t have potentially vulnerable software listening in on ports.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll probably do some &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;demian@raven ~&amp;gt;nmap localhost

Starting Nmap 5.00 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2014-07-11 09:51 CDT

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe some &lt;code&gt;netstat&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;demian@raven ~&amp;gt;netstat -l

&lt;p&gt;I checked it locally and noticed that &lt;code&gt;exim4&lt;/code&gt; was running and had a port open.  So I made sure that service was no
longer in the startup scripts and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/Daemon&quot;&gt;removed the daemon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Now Try from Laptop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be sure I ran it from &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; from my laptop.  This is what I saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;demian  ~  nmap neidetcher.com

&lt;p&gt;Whoah, that&amp;#39;s a lot of ports.  Obviously some hacker syndicate from Eastern Europe has replaced my version of &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt;
such that it doesn&amp;#39;t show the ports they have used to turn my server into a slave for 
their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet&quot;&gt;botnet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Apple Airport&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran across &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nephtaliproject.com/?p=129&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.  The deal is that Apple Airport will 
try to proxy protocols for you.  Apparently it doesn&amp;#39;t bother to check with the far-end servers to see if the
port is even available.  So, to you on your computer behind an Apple router, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; will think the port is hot.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two Years Remote</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Why Remote?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived in Denver, Colorado for 10 years.  I met my wife out there and like many
in Colorado we weren&amp;#39;t natives.  We decided that we should attempt to get closer 
to family if we could so that our two boys could have some good years with their
grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timewarnercable.com/&quot;&gt;Time Warner Cable&lt;/a&gt; and on a case by 
case basis they will make allowances for people to work remote.  It&amp;#39;s a big leap 
of faith and a progressive thing to do for a big cable company.  To me this buys
a lot of good will towards my employer.  I appreciate it and my wife appreciates
it.  That&amp;#39;s a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t say that me, being remote is better than me being on-site.  There are
good things and bad things.  Maybe it&amp;#39;s a wash but I don&amp;#39;t know.  But I am 
confident that me, being remote is better than the general population of software
engineers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things that Make it Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;History with Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a couple years of proving myself to the team before I went remote.  It 
also helped that a few of the guys on the team were long-time colleagues prior
to my current job.  So there&amp;#39;s some history and trust already.  I could do 
remote without that but it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Office&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to have an office with a door that closes.  This is a no-brainer.
Of course good Internet access.  Fortunately, the community I&amp;#39;m at in Louisiana 
has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lusfiber.com/&quot;&gt;metropolitan fiber to the curb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Routine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t keep the work hours of the home office, I&amp;#39;m just an hour ahead.  We 
have engineers in every time zone so I might as well work 9AM to 5PM 
in my time zone.  By 9AM I have worked out, had a shower and I&amp;#39;m sipping 
on a fresh cup of coffee ready for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also completely dressed just as I would be for work in-person.  I know 
others can work remote without being dressed but I see this as yet another
slippery slope.  In fact when I worked on-site there were days that I would
wear shorts but since I&amp;#39;ve been remote I always wear pants during work hours.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read warnings from remote workers that a danger you may run into is not 
knowing when to &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; work.  That has not been a problem for me.  Sure there have 
been a handful of times where operational concerns will have me working after
hours but this hasn&amp;#39;t been worse than any other situation.  So yeah, at 5PM my
time I&amp;#39;m out of my office and thinking about dinner with the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Standing Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team meetings that happen regularly with cameras and voice are great for 
getting back in touch to what your team is doing.  If these meetings go 
away then you can go days without seeing or hearing people.  That isn&amp;#39;t 
good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tooling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use a lot of tools to make the remote thing work.  What we&amp;#39;ve found is that
the quickness at which we can use a tool is almost more important than the
features of different tools.  We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://join.me/&quot;&gt;join.me&lt;/a&gt; for quick 
screen sharing and sometimes voice, also &lt;a href=&quot;http://skype.com/&quot;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; for chat 
and voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hardly pair-program but at the times where I did it was great with voice
and screen sharing.  join.me will even let you hand off mouse and keyboard
control to the person who is looking on the other end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to working remote, when I got on voice, the first thing I would
do is figure out how to get off the phone.  Being on the phone with others
was kind of creepy.  So yeah, you have to get over that.  Sometimes we&amp;#39;ll 
even just leave Skype on and not really say anything in particular.  You 
can mention things casually just as you would if you were co-located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course another nice thing about tooling is that you can turn it off or
ignore it.  I&amp;#39;m not the first person that&amp;#39;d say the ability to focus is one
of the best things about being remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;In-Person Trips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing beats getting out into the same place with people, talking, having a 
meal and maybe a drink.  Most any amount of friction and sharp edges can be
overcome by having food and drinks with people. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Javascript Is Alright</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Once Bitten&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at my second job as a programmer and still an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bradley.edu/&quot;&gt;undergrad&lt;/a&gt; 
I worked on a team that did an e-commerce site.  This would&amp;#39;ve been about 1998-1999.  It was for
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelibrarystore.com/&quot;&gt;The Library Store&lt;/a&gt;.  They were good clients.  The
back end was Java, holy cow I had JDBC code in my JSPs back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a UI guy that liked JavaScript.  He used it at the  end of the checkout process.&lt;br&gt;
You know where this is going, right.  At some point after the
release the customer called our office.  My manager wasn&amp;#39;t around and I was the most senior
person there so I took the call.  There was a guy on the other end of the line that had 
customers that couldn&amp;#39;t give him money because of our JavaScript.   To me this was no fun
and no amount of JavaScript coolness justified a customer being unable to check out.
That stuck with me throughout my career.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Full-Stack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I pride myself as a full-stack engineer my JavaScript-fu was weak.  I guess by 
full-stack meant being familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux, databases, web-servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL, persistence frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dependency injection frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java web frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML, CSS, a tiny bit of JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that full-stack is something of a thing.  And in to credibly call myself a full-stack programmer 
I have been in need of a tune-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;width:540px&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=%22full-stack%22&quot; title=&quot;&amp;#034;full-stack&amp;#034; Job Trends&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://www.indeed.com/trendgraph/jobgraph.png?q=%22full-stack%22&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;#034;full-stack&amp;#034; Job Trends graph&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;font-size:80%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=%22full-stack%22&quot;&gt;&amp;#034;full-stack&amp;#034; Job Trends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=%22full-stack%22&quot;&gt;&amp;#034;full-stack&amp;#034; jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 

&lt;h2&gt;Late to the Party&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work we have lab weeks, often times I&amp;#39;ll do something that is drudgery that needs to get 
done but this time around I decided that I should dive into JavaScript.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know anyone who learns this way but I ran through a &lt;a href=&quot;http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/video/programming/javascript/9781771370516&quot;&gt;Learning JavaScript Programming&lt;/a&gt;
video series on O&amp;#39;Reilly.  That was useful to get boot-strapped.  Then I came up with a manageable
little problem to solve.  I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://neidetcher.com/531.html&quot;&gt;5/3/1 Workout Calculator&lt;/a&gt;.  It
was a good place to start.  Some flow control, a bit of math and lots of working with the DOM to add
listeners and change values.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked my co-workers how to do some things and they quickly directed me to start using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jquery.com/&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;.
I assumed that I could get further with vanilla JavaScript but it seems that jQuery is almost a part
of JavaScript.  I was already finding answers to questions in StackOverflow that directed me towards
a solution in jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tooling is Good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getfirebug.com/&quot;&gt;FireBug&lt;/a&gt; and all the similar consoles in major browsers are great to work with.
And the JavaScript support in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot;&gt;IntelliJ&lt;/a&gt; impresses me as well.  A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johnnywey&quot;&gt;colleague&lt;/a&gt; 
said that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/&quot;&gt;WebStorm&lt;/a&gt; is more light-weight but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164?pr=phpStorm&quot;&gt;IdeaVim&lt;/a&gt;
plugin isn&amp;#39;t available for it and that&amp;#39;s one of my biggest productivity boosters. I didn&amp;#39;t know 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp&quot;&gt;selectors&lt;/a&gt; were a thing.  They&amp;#39;re  very 
powerful, they make doing things with jQuery easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad I took the time to get into JavaScript.  It has changed how I think the browser can interact
with the server.  Of course I knew you could do all this stuff but I didn&amp;#39;t realize how easy it
all is.  Especially with frameworks like jQuery my initial bad experiences with JavaScript are less
likely to happen since they take care of the browser inconsistencies for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here I guess I need to interact with the server with JavaScript.  I also plan on  using 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://angularjs.org/&quot;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
