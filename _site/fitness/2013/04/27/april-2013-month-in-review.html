<h2>Home Gym</h2>

<p>It all started with some bro leisurely doing super-sets that
included chain curls in the only available squat rack that uses standard weights (non metric).
It was my squat day, oh man.  I lifted at Red&#39;s for a year and it&#39;s alright, but their equipment setup 
is goofy.  No wonder they have so many machines as opposed to barbells and plates; no one puts anything
away at Red&#39;s.</p>

<p>So I started to put together a home gym.  I have a horrible barbell that I got for free.  I have a set
of hi-temp bumper plates (recycled tires) from Rogue and a bench and squat stand from Valor.  I got some
small standard weights for Ryder&#39;s birthday this year.  Those are good for shoulder dumbell work.  Also
I had a few kettlebellls.  I&#39;m able to get in everything I need with this equipment, it&#39;s awesome.</p>

<p>Workouts are going great.  The weather in Louisiana is awesome this time of year we&#39;ll see how it is 
when it gets very hot this summer and when it gets chilly in the following winter.
What&#39;s especially cool is on week 4 of 5/3/1 where you&#39;re de-loading.  I don&#39;t have to drive 15 minutes
each way to the gym just to kind of go through the motions and not push myself too hard.</p>

<h2>Too Aggressive</h2>

<p>With 5/3/1 you&#39;re supposed to up your upper body lifts by 5 lbs and lower
body lifts by 10 lbs every month.  For April I decided to up my deadlift
by 15 lbs and my press by 10 lbs.  For those exercises I was hitting 10 
reps for week 3 of 5/3/1 regularly and I thought I should bump it up 
more quickly.</p>

<h3>April numbers</h3>

<ul>
<li>pres: 170x6 (197 C1RM)</li>
<li>deadlift: 330x3 (349 C1RM)</li>
<li>bench: 270x5 (304 C1RM) </li>
<li>squat: 270x3 (286 C1RM)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Squat</h2>

<p>I still get video of my squat and put it online, especially on the 5/3/1 week.  I really want to keep myself honest here.  This shot is kind of low, off of my
bench but I can see my thigh make a brief appearance above my hip crease so I think I&#39;m in good shape.</p>
