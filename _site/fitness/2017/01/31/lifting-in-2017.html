    <p>Just checking in here to talk about what&#39;s working for me currently.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<ul>
<li>walking between workout days</li>
<li>tracking accessory work in notebook</li>
<li>incorporating the incline bench</li>
<li>upper-body 5/3/1 goals are about maintenance</li>
<li>lower-body 5/3/1 goals are about getting back to my modest peaks </li>
<li>still doing 5/3/1 so beginning of workouts look like power-lifting</li>
<li>upper-body finishing work looks like bodybuilding</li>
<li>lower-body finishing work looks like conditioning</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stepping Back</h2>

<p>Earlier in 2016 I felt a tweak in my back when doing the dead.  It wasn&#39;t much
but I immediately took a week off and dropped my weights.  I also stopped using
a belt.  I don&#39;t compete, I don&#39;t have huge goals I just want to stay strong.  I&#39;d
rather deadlift 225 at 70 than get impressive numbers in my 40s.</p>

<h2>What I do Now</h2>

<p>Still doing <a href="https://jimwendler.com/collections/books-programs/products/5-3-1-second-edition-hard-copy">5/3/1</a> with 
some modifications of course.  I entirely threw out the deload week of 5/3/1, the 
rest of the work outs are spread across the month.  This gives me good recovery time,
probably an important thing as I get older.</p>

<h3>Better Training Notes</h3>

<p>I figure out how I want to progess over the year for the main lifts for 5/3/1. I 
have it in a single page spreadsheet for the whole year.  Each workout checks this 
off.  But I wasn&#39;t tracking any of the rest of my accessory lifts.  I ended up in 
a situation where I added way too much weight for a tricep pull-over.  I was able
to do the lift but my connective tissue wasn&#39;t ready.  This didn&#39;t manifest as 
some lack of mobility but I was aware of it and I knew I messed up.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/misc/training_log.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Since then
I started tracking everything I do each workout so that I can make sure that
accessory lifts advance in a sensible way.  I think this has been important
especially because I&#39;m frankly holding back on my 5/3/1 lifts, playing the long
game.</p>

<h3>Walks</h3>

<p>On days that I don&#39;t lift I go for a half-hour walk.  It&#39;s been good to keep the
routine going, good time to zone out before the work day and listen to a podcast.  If
it&#39;s the weekend and we have other plans I bail on this without hesitation.</p>

<p>It goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sun:</li>
<li>Mon: press</li>
<li>Tue: walk </li>
<li>Wed: dead</li>
<li>Thu: walk</li>
<li>Fri: bench</li>
<li>Sat: </li>
<li>Sun: squat</li>
<li>Mon: walk</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upper-body Days</h3>

<p>Being 5/3/1, the first sets are about the 5/3/1 sets.  It&#39;s power-lifting focused, it&#39;s
programmed and it&#39;s what I <em>need</em> to hit for the day.  Everything else is up for grabs.</p>

<p>I think of the upper-body days as alternating between the vertical plane for the press
and the horizontal plane for the bench.  So I make sure that I am doing compound pull 
movements that complement the push movements.  </p>

<p>The rest of upper-body days I train like a bodybuilder.  It&#39;s about vanity and trying to
look good in a t-shirt.</p>

<h4>Press</h4>

<p>I did get my press up to 205.  I can do it but it&#39;s scary putting that much up.  It feels
like I&#39;m pushing my luck or risking an injury.  For this year I have my maxes for press
down to 185.</p>

<p>After 5/3/1 press sets I do an incline thin-grip bench.  Being incline it involves the 
delts more than a bench would and it&#39;s a good compound movement to get the triceps going.</p>

<p>For press days I obviously hit the delts hard.  I think the best thing I do for delts is
light dumbell work.  I do sets of 10, 8 and 6 reps with 21 pounds, then another
set of 10, 8 and 6 for 19 pounds then another for 17 pounds.  Note that for the front-raise
I do 10 reps in total, not 10 reps each shoulder.  The front delts get plenty of work already
from doing compound movements like the overhead press, benching and so on.</p>

<p>To go on a tangent here, barbell work is optimal for growing a solid base, it&#39;s your
meat and potatoes.  I think it&#39;s difficult to really get your shoulders to pop with 
just the barbell.  Since I started more serious dumbell work on the shoulders I have 
noticed that my shoulders and delts have responded well.</p>

<img src="http://www.exrx.net/AnimatedEx/DeltoidLateral/DBLateralRaise.gif" alt="">
<img src="http://www.exrx.net/AnimatedEx/DeltoidAnterior/DBAlternatingFrontRaise.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Press day is also tricep day.  I do a tricep pull-over that I consider to be a pull
movement as well.  Yep a tricep movement that I consider a pull, nuts huh?  It hits 
the lats as well as the triceps.  I do it almost like Mark Rippetoe explains but 
I go farther back, the plates touch the floor at the bottom of the motion.  It&#39;s 
a good stretch.  </p>

    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rh3MHnRI_I" 
    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    

<p>Recently I have also added single-joint dumbell work to finish off the triceps at the
end of the workout.  The single-joint, bodybuilding stuff goes at the end and is very optional.</p>

<h3>Bench</h3>

<p>My bench is particularly low, I have it at 275 right now and my goal for the end of the year
is to be at 275.  I just don&#39;t care to improve on it.  It seems like pushing the bench is a
great opportunity for injury.  I know it&#39;s a common theme but I&#39;d rather bench 225 at 70 than
push 315 at 46.</p>

<p>I have however gotten more serious about upping the weights for dumbell press and incline
dumbell press.  These feel good, the range of motion and flexibility in position makes me
think I&#39;m less likely to injure myself using those lifts.</p>

<p>The incline bench is new.  Since I haven&#39;t done an incline dumbell press in years I started
really low and I&#39;m going to ramp up very gradually.</p>

<p>On bench day I do biceps as well.  This is the bro-lifting day.  I was doing curl-bar curls
and I felt funkiness at the insertion point at the bottom of my bicep.  Now I do dumbell
curls and it feels a lot better.  I might do regular dumbell curls and/ or hammer curls.</p>

<h2>Leg Days</h2>

<p>On lower-body days I alternate my 5/3/1 sets with some form of sit-up.  I&#39;ll either do leg 
raises on a bench or sit-ups on the <a href="http://www.roguefitness.com/abmat">abmat</a>.  The world 
will never see my abs but I think sit-ups help keep the core together for squats.  </p>

<p>After the 5/3/1 sets I might do 1 additional assistance exercise to help out with strength or
hypertrophy.</p>

<p>Whereas the tail end of my upper-body days I work out like a bodybuilder, to finish my 
lower-body days I work out like a cross-fitter.  Albeit a remedial, out of shape cross-fitter.
This conditioning work uses kettlebells, jump rope and the medicine ball come into play.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll do 3 rounds of something like this going <a href="http://boxlifemagazine.com/benefits-of-the-emom-every-minute-on-the-minute-workout/">every minute on the minute</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">exercise      | reps
--------------|-----
KB swing #70  | 20
KB snatch #35 | 20
jump rope     | 20
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or maybe something like this but I take a 10 breath rest between exercises.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">exercise        | reps
----------------|-----
KB snatch #53   | 10
KB swing #70    | 10
KB goblet squat | 5
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Dead</h3>

<p>For the assistance exercise I usually do either a barbell hip-thrust or the sumo deadlift.  For the
sumo deadlift I kind of do like a romanian deadlift, feeling the stretch at the bottom, touch and
go.  </p>

<h3>Squat</h3>

<p>I&#39;d really like to get my squat back up to 315 this year.  Accessory has been more squats, doing
a light load (currently ~155) for 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 reps with 10 breath pause in between sets.</p>
