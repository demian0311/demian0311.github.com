<p>Over the past couple years I have gotten back into weight lifting.  It has
been great, I&#39;m stronger than I was when I was in the Marines 20 years ago.
I&#39;m nowhere near as fast though, maybe we&#39;ll work on that in the future.</p>

<h3>Kettlebell</h3>

<p>When I first got back into lifting I picked up the kettlebell at the 
recommendation of Bryan Noll.  This was a good place to start.  If I was
stranded on a desert island and could only have one piece of equipment it
would be a 53 pound kettlebell.  The simplicity of the device makes it
easy to get going.</p>

<p>I read Enter the Kettlebell, it&#39;s a great resource to start.  It&#39;s probably
enough just to buy yourself a kettlebell and watch some YouTub videos.</p>

<h3>5x5</h3>

<p>Eventually I wanted more body composition changes so I put together a
5x5 program for myself.  I was inspired by the <a href="http://stronglifts.com/">Stong Lifts e-book</a>
but didn&#39;t use his program.  He lays out a full-body system where every
day you work all muscle groups using old-school multi-joint barbell lifts.<br>
I think my body doesn&#39;t recover quickly 
enough to lift a few times in a week.  I have always been that way even
though I respond well to lifting weights.</p>

<p>I created a split routine that was push, pull and legs.  With a handful
of exercises that were all 5 sets of 5 reps.  I got great results with this.</p>

<h3>5/3/1</h3>

<p>In the fall of 2011 I started <a href="http://www.jimwendler.com/">Jim Wendlers 5/3/1 program</a>.
5/3/1 is an undulating progression routine where you increase weights for 3 weeks
then take a week to do light work.  The 4 weeks you do the same gradual progression
but with 5-10 more pounds.  A program like 5/3/1 makes sense when you are no 
longer able to make linear progression of 5 pounds for a lift between workouts.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t hold a candle to the time under the bar and intelligence that Jim Wendler
has but after a couple cycles I quit doing 5/3/1 strictly.</p>

<p>There are a couple reasons I didn&#39;t like 5/3/1 strictly:
* my military press or overhead press is already in great shape and I don&#39;t need 
  an entire day for shoulder work.
* I didn&#39;t like the abscence of a day spent on back and pulling.  Although the
  5/3/1 deadlift day would probably be seen as a back day also.  5/3/1 also suggests
  doing pull-ups between all push movements, that would get you lots of time pulling.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably give strict 5/3/1 another chance but for now this is what I&#39;m doing.</p>
