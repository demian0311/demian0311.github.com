<h2>The Iron</h2>

<p>I think lifting weights teaches you a lot.  It can be a metaphor for
many things.  Understanding the concept of <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-in-world/201207/the-power-delaying-gratification">delayed gratification</a> 
is is one of the most obvious benefits of training.
Henry Rollins has a great story called <a href="http://www.oldtimestrongman.com/strength-articles/iron-henry-rollins">The Iron</a>, you should go read it.</p>

<p>Of course I want my boys to have as many opportunities as possible, I decided 
to start introducing them to weights more seriously with the new year.
They&#39;re aged 6 and 3.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://startingstrength.com/articles/young_strength_starr.pdf">Youngsters Need Strength Too</a>
Bill Starr sites studies that show there is no effect on growth plates or any other overly cautionary
concerns most people have.   </p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>Advancing in weight is a distant concern.  Here are my goals for them 
in doing this.</p>

<ul>
<li>be able to lift safely</li>
<li>have fun</li>
<li>develop the habit of training (it&#39;s something you just do)</li>
<li>know what hard work is</li>
<li>understand good form </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Program</h2>

<p>There&#39;s only one workout and this is it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">  exercise                sets  reps  weight
  ----------------------- ----- ----- ------
  press                   3     5     30
  kettlebell deadlift     3     5     26
  bench                   3     5     30
  kettlebell goblet squat 3     5     15
  rope pull 30 feet       3     1     26
</code></pre></div>
<p>Some random points and rationale about the workout:</p>

<ul>
<li>Workout twice a week not on consecutive days.</li>
<li><em>press</em> is a vertical push.</li>
<li><em>kettlebell deadlift</em> is vertical pull, covering posterior chain and core.</li>
<li><em>kettlebell deadlift</em> demonstrates a neutral spine.</li>
<li><em>bench</em> is a horizontal push.</li>
<li><em>kettlebell goblet squat</em> is quads and core. </li>
<li><em>rope pull</em> is a horizontal pull, some posterior chain and core.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rope pull is done with a 26 lb kettlebell tied to the end of a 30 foot 
battle rope.  The 3 year old pulls out the empty end of the rope and then 
the 6 year old pulls the weighted end towards him.  Rinse and repeat that
3 times.</p>

<p>The 6 year old is working on good form and staying safe.</p>

<p>The 3 year old does 3 reps of everything instead of 5.  Or instead of 3 reps
he does whatever the heck he wants to have fun.  Usually he&#39;s eager to show
how strong he is and he has a smile on his face.</p>
