    <h2>Nailed It</h2>

<p>A couple weeks ago was the first time I tried to attempt 
to deadlift 365 since I failed in November.  It doesn&#39;t 
exactly look like it but the first rep was harder than
the second and third.  </p>

<p>A lot of my
lifting goals happen to match up with some convenient 
numbers for adding plates to a bar.  365 is the weight of
a bar, 3 45 pound plates on each side and a 25 pound plate
on each side as well.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" 
   src="//www.youtube.com/embed/7nN-Il_HcRw" 
   frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2>Failed It</h2>

<p>This is me failing to deadlift 365 back in November.  I thought 
I was close so I tried it for a second time but still failed.
I also failed an attempt at 365 about a year ago.  I&#39;m not even
sure why I tried it.  I think I nailed 315 and then just assumed
I should try to do 365.  I had to scratch and claw for each pound
to get up to 365.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" 
   src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YyydMg52xg4" 
   frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2>What Now?</h2>

<p>This is what I think I&#39;ll do for all of my lifts as I reach my 
goal in poundages.  For now I&#39;m just going to think it through
for the deadlift.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to keep the weights where they are.  I might even leave the
numbers where they are forever.  From here I see going into 2
phases.</p>

<h3>Increase Reps from 5/3/1 to 7/5/3</h3>

<p>I acknowledge none of this makes sense unless you understand how 5/3/1 works.
Gradually I want to bump up my reps for my 5/3/1 sets.  For example
in February I&#39;m doing 6/4/2.  Like I said I&#39;ll keep the weights where
they are.  Assuming I hit all my lifts, then the following month I&#39;ll 
go to 7/3/5.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how my 5/3/1 sets look for Jan, Feb and Mar look.  I&#39;m leaving 
out deload weeks here.</p>

<h4>January</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">  5 250   3 267.5 5 287.5
  5 287.5 3 307.5 3 325
  5 325   3 345   1 365
</code></pre></div>
<h4>February</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">  6 250  4 270  6 290
  6 290  4 310  4 325
  6 325  4 345  2 365
</code></pre></div>
<h4>March</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">  7 250  5 270  7 290
  7 290  5 310  5 325
  7 325  5 345  3 365
</code></pre></div>
<p>So the idea is, for the rest of my life I don&#39;t deadlift more than
365 pounds.  I&#39;ll do it once a month and I&#39;ll do it for a triple.</p>

<h3>Add Cardio with EMOM</h3>

<p>Once I increase my reps of my 5/3/1 sets (now 7/5/3, heh), then I will
introduce some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training">HIIT</a> using <a href="http://www.theboxmag.com/crossfit-workouts/emom-every-minute-on-the-minute-a-formula-for-volume-and-skill-development/">EMOM</a>.</p>

<p>For assistance work I always do 3 sets of 10 of whatever exercise I
did for the 5/3/1 sets.  So for deadlifts my first assistance exercise
is deadlifts yet again for 3 sets of 10 reps at 215 pounds.</p>

<p>The rest of my deadlift assistance work looks like this:
      bb hip thrust 5 20 185
      kb swing      5 20 53</p>

<p>I&#39;ll do them as a cycle, so hip thrusts then kettlebell swing then
onto the 2nd round for hip thrusts, more kettlebell swings, you get
the idea.</p>

<p>The first month, I guess that&#39;ll be April.  I&#39;ll do the last 2 cycles
as EMOM.  </p>

<ol>
<li>bb hip thrust, kb swing</li>
<li>bb hip thrust, kb swing</li>
<li>bb hip thrust, kb swing </li>
<li>bb hip thrust, kb swing EMOM</li>
<li>bb hip thrust, kb swing EMOM</li>
</ol>

<p>The next month, looking like May I&#39;ll do the last 3 cycles as EMOM and 
on from there until all the sets of my assistance work is EMOM.  This
should really get my heart going.</p>

<p>At the end of all this I hope to maintain solid strength and get in 
much better cardio shape.  We&#39;ll see how it works.</p>
