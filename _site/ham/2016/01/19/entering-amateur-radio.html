    <p class="post-meta">Jan 19, 2016</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>When I was in the Marines I remember a European NGO worker (I think 
he was with <a href="https://www.icrc.org/">ICRC</a>) had a radio setup such that 
he could communicate around the world.  That seemed interesting at 
the time.  I don&#39;t remember if he used it to conduct NGO business or
just communicate with people back home while he was in in remote parts 
of Africa.</p>

<p>Recently the local amateur radio club, <a href="http://www.w5ddl.org/">Acadiana Amateur Radio 
Association</a>, was generous enough to conduct 
<a href="http://theadvocate.com/news/acadiana/14385399-123/lafayette-class-helps-ham-radio-enthusiasts-learn-about-hobby-prepare-for-licensing">free training</a> at the <a href="http://www.lafayettesciencemuseum.org/">Lafayette 
Science Museum</a>.</p>

<p>I guess I should also out myself as something of a prepper.  You get
accidental death and dismemberment insurance because there&#39;s a remote
chance something bad will happen.  In the same sense you can have
interests that are fun but also prepare you if there is an emergency
at a local or national level.  I think amateur radio is one of those
interests.  Knowing what I know now about amateur radio I would want
a capable HAM in my fortified zombie-proof compound.</p>

<p>I decided to go and I brought along my son Ryder.  The classes were
great, a good mix of general topics to get us engaged in HAM radio
and test preparation.</p>

<h2>Getting Certified</h2>

<p>The FCC allows citizens to use portions of the radio spectrum for
personal use.  To prevent the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a> the FCC requires
that citizens be licensed to use that spectrum.</p>

<p>There are 3 amateur radio licenses.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Technician</strong> lets you talk around town and possibly within the state</li>
<li><strong>General</strong> lets you talk nationally and possibly even all over the world</li>
<li><strong>Extra</strong> frees up more of the spectrum to do more of the same</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gordo&#39;s Books</h3>

<p>Besides the class I read through the <a href="http://www.gordonwestradioschool.com/">Gordon West</a> books 
to prepare.  The books
are high quality, good paper, good color.  He has a good approach I think, he
co-locates the content with the questions and answers.  The dimensions of the
book make it easier to bring with you as you run errands so that if you have
a spare moment you can study.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Technician-2014-18-Element-License-Preparation/dp/0945053797/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453213371&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gordon+west">Technician Class 2014-18</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/General-Class-2015-2019-Gordon-West/dp/0945053827/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453213505&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=gordon+west">General Class 2015-2019</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Studying and Practice Testing</h3>

<p><a href="https://hamstudy.org/">hamstudy.org</a> was another invaluable resource to
prepare.  The only downside is that you need Internet connectivity to 
study.  The site seems to be smart about what it puts in front of you, 
as the learner your main mission is to chug through it until you&#39;re at around
85% so that you can surely pass the tests.</p>

<p>One thing I learned too late was that you can go into specific sections
of the test that you have trouble with.  This lets you focus on those questions
and see them more often.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the only way to go but perhaps it&#39;s
good to mix it up like that.</p>

<h3>My Suggestions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t peak too early, I did and I had to keep studying for a couple weeks to
retain.  Give yourself 2 or 3 weeks and go for it.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t focus too much on the formulas.  I know the formulas and I get them but
I just memorized the answers.</li>
<li>Unit conversion (like from kHz to MHz) moves 3 decimal places, exclude answers that do not fit that.</li>
<li>Except for decibels the math is always either multiplication or division, knowing
the right answer fits that will get you far.</li>
<li>Always end transmissions with your call sign.</li>
<li>Always err on being safe.</li>
<li>Always err on being nice. </li>
<li>Mnemonics.</li>
</ul>

<p>To elaborate on the mnemonics, here are a couple that get me through 6 or so of the
answers.  If you&#39;ve been through the questions you know how it helps.</p>

<ul>
<li>There&#39;s a duck in a field with a magnet in his mouth, he has a chain around his 
neck and it says &quot;Henry&quot;, he flies up and from the side his lips look like an inductor schematic.</li>
<li>There&#39;s an Arab guy named Farad in a field wearing a cap with a lightning bolt on it, the
top of his cap looks like a capacitor schematic.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>Before their monthly meeting the local amateur radio club holds tests conducted by 
trained volunteers.  You can take as many tests as you would like for $15 but if you 
fail a test and want to re-take it you have to pay another $15.  I was able to take
both the technician and the general tests.  I did alright on the technician, for the 
general I was unsure but they told me I passed.  They asked if I wanted to go for
extra but I didn&#39;t want to waste their time.  All the volunteers were awesome and helpful.</p>

<h2>Call Sign</h2>

<p>A week after testing I looked up my name with the FCC.  I was assigned the call sign
<strong>KG5KZM</strong>.  Not too bad but I decided to apply for a vanity call sign right 
away.  Just like vanity plates for your car you can try to get a call sign of 
your choosing as long as it&#39;s available.  It also has to be the right format for 
your license.</p>

<p>You pick a dozen or so call signs you would like in priority order, wait 18 days and
find out what you got.  I chose a bunch of variations on X9DLN to have my initials.
Not very creative but seems easy to remember.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s Next</h2>

<p>We have to see if my son Ryder can pass for technician.  He&#39;s slowly getting there.</p>

<p>I have some hand-held radios that you&#39;d use for local communication.  I&#39;d like to get
into pack portable HF on battery and solar, lots to learn.  If I get up to speed I 
might look into <a href="http://www.arrl.org/ares">ARES</a> to be helpful in emergencies.</p>
