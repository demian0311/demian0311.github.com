<p>This is a lesson from lifting weights that applies to programming or
pretty much anything.  Results come from <em>the grind</em>.  What is the grind?
It starts with knowing where you want to go.  After that it&#39;s coming up
with a good plan to get there.  Assuming you have done well in the first
two parts, the last part is the grind.  You&#39;re confident in your goal and
you&#39;re confident in the plan that is going to get you there.  From there
you just have to execute.  Often times this means showing up, punching the
clock and doing the thing.</p>

<h2>From the Iron Game</h2>

<p>Despite all the ab-rollers, thigh blasters, muscle confusion and even CrossFit
it turns out that the best way to get strong is to grind it out.  You don&#39;t 
need complicated equipment or the latest workout from a website every week.
A man, barbell, weights, squat stands and maybe a bench are all that you need. 
You get to deadlift 315 because last month you were able to pull 310.  And you
don&#39;t get there by gimmicks you get there by showing up and doing the same
thing but with a little more weight.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the lesson that the iron game teaches.  To get strong you do the basics
and you grind it out.</p>
