  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I just went to <a href="https://uberconf.com">UberConf</a> 2016.  As always Jay Zimmerman puts on a great show.  As great
as UberConf is, it&#39;s probably a conference you can get to every other year.  Lots of familiar speakers, they&#39;re
all great.  I was surprised to see so few people I know in attendance.  Maybe people come to their senses and
get into management and I&#39;m still slinging code.</p>

<h2>Reactive Programming</h2>

<p>I took the all day workshop on <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">reactive programming</a> given 
by <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/">Venkat</a>.  It gave me a good basis for reactive programming. 
Venkat gave an entertaining presentation as always and he covered a lot of ground.</p>

<p>My hangup would be that he focused on the idea of streams or data-flow computing.  He gave examples like stock data 
or telemetry data continually streaming into your application to be processed.  I&#39;ve been coding 
professionally for almost 20 years and I have never been in a domain where that happens.  Honestly 
that kind of turned me off.  It&#39;s not sexy but the fact is developers primarily create HTTP front-ends 
for either a persistence or some other back-end system.  From Venkat&#39;s perspective if your app doesn&#39;t
deal with streams of information then it&#39;s not going to be of much use.  </p>

<h2>Spring and Cloud</h2>

<p>I recently have become re-interested in Spring.  I used Scala for a few years and then Groovy/ Grails.  I
forgot how useful all the Spring frameworks were.  They have kept up with things and a lot of the battle 
of being productive is just being aware of what&#39;s out there.</p>

<p>I did a lot of by <a href="http://habuma.com/">Craig Walls</a>, they were great.  The theme of Craig&#39;s 
talks were centered around <em>cloud native</em>.  I like the idea, the point is that there are some 
new tools and concerns we&#39;ll need when going to the cloud.  It doesn&#39;t mean that all this is 
exclusive just to the cloud.  There was mention of <a href="http://12factor.net/">12 Factor Application</a> I&#39;ve
gone through it before, seems like it&#39;s something I need to re-visit.</p>

<p>He covered a lot of things about Spring.  <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> is so huge and frankly they 
do a so-so job of organizing, documenting, deprecating and communicating best practices.  There&#39;s 
just so much it&#39;s probably very hard for them to keep a handle on it.  My point is that it&#39;s great to 
hear someone speak that is up to speed on the best practices, how everything is positioned and really
just letting you know what&#39;s out there.</p>

<p>I also went to a lot of <a href="http://www.mattstine.com/">Matt Stine</a> talks about microservices.  In covering
microservices he also touched on Spring frameworks that help you.  Matt also covered reactive programming
in a more pragmatic way such that I could imagine using it with real work. </p>

<h2>Netflix</h2>

<p><a href="https://nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/speaker/andrew_glover">Andy Glover</a> gave a keynote on 
Netflix.  I&#39;m thankful for all the opensource software they have put out.  At my current work we
all looked like heroes just because we wired up <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">Hystrix circuit breakers</a>.  </p>

<p>That presentation went on about how great Netflix is, good on them, they&#39;re doing amazing stuff.  But 
one thing that rubbed me wrong is how proud they are that they <em>only</em> hire senior engineers.  Is that a 
good thing if everyone just hires senior engineers?</p>

<h2>Docker</h2>

<p>I did a 2 session Docker workshop.  There were a <em>lot</em> of people in attendance and any time you&#39;re doing
virtualization with more than 100 people things go off the rails quick.  So <a href="https://juddsolutions.blogspot.com/">Chrisopher Judd</a> 
had his work cut out for him.   I was glad I attended, for whatever reason I couldn&#39;t fit some Docker concepts
into my head just from reading but the sessions were useful.</p>

<h2>More Take-Aways</h2>

<ul>
<li>There&#39;s an interesting relationship with the cloud and microservices.  If you want to have microservices
you probably want to do cloud things to manage them even if you don&#39;t use a cloud.</li>
<li>Spring and Netflix are doing great things, if you&#39;re doing microservices or cloud stuff on the JVM you 
probably want to get familiar with the opensource tools they have available.</li>
<li>If you want to leverage Twitter&#39;s <a href="http://zipkin.io/">Zipkin</a> you can use <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/">Spring Cloud Sleuth</a>.</li>
<li>At least right now it&#39;s too soon for me to poke around with Java9 module capabilities.  It&#39;ll be interesting
when there is build system and tooling support.</li>
<li>Use Netflix <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka">Eureka</a> for service discovery.  This prevents you from hard-coding
URLs to services your application depends on.</li>
<li>Use Netflix <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/zuul">Zuul</a> to dynamically route services.</li>
<li>Zuul could be used to host static assets <em>and</em> be a gateway for services.  If you do this then you don&#39;t have to 
worry about cross origin request concerns.</li>
<li>Netflix has an interesting approach to load balancing, <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon">Ribbon</a> runs on 
the client, is made aware of services by Eureka and does a sort of load balancing in the client.  There isn&#39;t
a load balancer that sits in front of services.  So, the client using Ribbon will round-robin or lay off of
poorly behaving services for you.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config">Spring Cloud Config</a> to manage configuration in 
your cloud applications.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-elasticsearch-logstash-and-kibana-elk-stack-on-ubuntu-14-04">ELK</a>
seems to be the approach for distributed, searchable logging.  Seems like a bunch of work to get going, we use Splunk 
at work.</li>
