<h2>Why Remote?</h2>

<p>I lived in Denver, Colorado for 10 years.  I met my wife out there and like many
in Colorado we weren&#39;t natives.  We decided that we should attempt to get closer 
to family if we could so that our two boys could have some good years with their
grandparents.</p>

<p>I work at <a href="http://www.timewarnercable.com/">Time Warner Cable</a> and on a case by 
case basis they will make allowances for people to work remote.  It&#39;s a big leap 
of faith and a progressive thing to do for a big cable company.  To me this buys
a lot of good will towards my employer.  I appreciate it and my wife appreciates
it.  That&#39;s a factor.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t say that me, being remote is better than me being on-site.  There are
good things and bad things.  Maybe it&#39;s a wash but I don&#39;t know.  But I am 
confident that me, being remote is better than the general population of software
engineers. </p>

<h2>Things that Make it Work</h2>

<h3>History with Team</h3>

<p>I had a couple years of proving myself to the team before I went remote.  It 
also helped that a few of the guys on the team were long-time colleagues prior
to my current job.  So there&#39;s some history and trust already.  I could do 
remote without that but it helps.</p>

<h3>Office</h3>

<p>You need to have an office with a door that closes.  This is a no-brainer.
Of course good Internet access.  Fortunately, the community I&#39;m at in Louisiana 
has <a href="http://www.lusfiber.com/">metropolitan fiber to the curb</a>.</p>

<h3>Routine</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t keep the work hours of the home office, I&#39;m just an hour ahead.  We 
have engineers in every time zone so I might as well work 9AM to 5PM 
in my time zone.  By 9AM I have worked out, had a shower and I&#39;m sipping 
on a fresh cup of coffee ready for work.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also completely dressed just as I would be for work in-person.  I know 
others can work remote without being dressed but I see this as yet another
slippery slope.  In fact when I worked on-site there were days that I would
wear shorts but since I&#39;ve been remote I always wear pants during work hours.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read warnings from remote workers that a danger you may run into is not 
knowing when to <em>stop</em> work.  That has not been a problem for me.  Sure there have 
been a handful of times where operational concerns will have me working after
hours but this hasn&#39;t been worse than any other situation.  So yeah, at 5PM my
time I&#39;m out of my office and thinking about dinner with the family.</p>

<h3>Standing Meetings</h3>

<p>Team meetings that happen regularly with cameras and voice are great for 
getting back in touch to what your team is doing.  If these meetings go 
away then you can go days without seeing or hearing people.  That isn&#39;t 
good.</p>

<h3>Tooling</h3>

<p>We use a lot of tools to make the remote thing work.  What we&#39;ve found is that
the quickness at which we can use a tool is almost more important than the
features of different tools.  We use <a href="https://join.me/">join.me</a> for quick 
screen sharing and sometimes voice, also <a href="http://skype.com/">Skype</a> for chat 
and voice.</p>

<p>We hardly pair-program but at the times where I did it was great with voice
and screen sharing.  join.me will even let you hand off mouse and keyboard
control to the person who is looking on the other end.</p>

<p>Prior to working remote, when I got on voice, the first thing I would
do is figure out how to get off the phone.  Being on the phone with others
was kind of creepy.  So yeah, you have to get over that.  Sometimes we&#39;ll 
even just leave Skype on and not really say anything in particular.  You 
can mention things casually just as you would if you were co-located.</p>

<p>Of course another nice thing about tooling is that you can turn it off or
ignore it.  I&#39;m not the first person that&#39;d say the ability to focus is one
of the best things about being remote.</p>

<h3>In-Person Trips</h3>

<p>Nothing beats getting out into the same place with people, talking, having a 
meal and maybe a drink.  Most any amount of friction and sharp edges can be
overcome by having food and drinks with people. </p>
