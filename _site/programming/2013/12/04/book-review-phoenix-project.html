<p>This book is about an IT manager.  I don&#39;t want to give spoilers because
even though the book isn&#39;t perfect I think that anyone in the software
business should read it.  To that end I don&#39;t want to ruin the book for 
you.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>In many of the situations that came up in the book I was reminded of
very similar things that have happened to me in my career.  The situations
were similar in the technical nature of what happened.  They all seemed
very plausible and relatable.</p>

<p>There were also things that happened that were driven by the business that
felt familiar.  Companies and IT departments often find themselves doing
sub-optimal things for very compelling reasons.  Again, these types of
situations were very relatable.</p>

<p>The book is well crafted to translate the lean practices from manufacturing
into software.  It all lines up a little bit too nice but it is quite
instructional.</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>Even if you get it, the likelyhood that you will end up in an organization
that is receptive to some good lean and devops practices is remote.  It&#39;s
even more remote that you will find yourself in the right position in such
a company. </p>

<h2>The Conclusion</h2>

<p>Even if you won&#39;t be able to change your IT organization the week after you
read this book I still think you should read this book.  You should get as
many of your co-workers to read this book as possible.</p>
