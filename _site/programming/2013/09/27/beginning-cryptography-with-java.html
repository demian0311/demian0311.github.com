<h2>Getting my Ass Handed to Me</h2>

<p>At work our PCI compliant Grails application needs to make 2-way SSL calls to
another PCI compliant SOAP service.  Well you know this is gonna kind of suck
for a little bit, you have to assume it&#39;ll take a few days to get everything
set up right.  It turned out that it took me a few weeks to get all this done.</p>

<p>I had some legit distractions in that time but it took me much longer than it
should have.  What hurts even more is that the main issue I had was nothing to
do with SSL.  However, the lack of knowledge and confidence in SSL kind of 
prevented me from seeing my problems clearly.</p>

<p>The recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program">NSA/ PRISM</a>)
scandal has me a bit more interested in privacy and security.  Digging into
the security APIs and the pieces involved gave me a greater appreciation for
current events.</p>

<h2>Let&#39;s Learn Me Some Security</h2>

<p>So I resolved to learn more about security and SSL as it applies to the JVM 
platform.  Honestly I initially thought I would take the Coursera class
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto">Cryptography I</a>.  But the math 
notation scared me and I was concerned that after investing 6 weeks of my
time I still wouldn&#39;t know the Java APIs very well or have a solid 
practical understanding.  </p>

<p>I decided to just crack a book on my own and learn some Java security.  It&#39;s
a weird space in that there hasn&#39;t been a lot of advancement in the APIs.  I 
guess that means that they created the initial APIs for Java well enough
such that there isn&#39;t any serious churn.</p>

<p>That lead me to a 2005 dead-tree book <a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Beginning-Cryptography-with-Java.productCd-0764596330.html">Beginning Cryptography with Java</a>.
As far as I know you can&#39;t even get it in an electronic version but that was
alright because I had some trips ahead of me and it was something I could read
to keep my mind off of the impending doom from airplane take-offs and landings.</p>

<h2>Affirmation that Scala is Cool</h2>

<p>The book is in Java, 2005.  At my day job I do Scala and Groovy.  I decided to
do the examples.  The process of implementing the Java examples in Scala was
surprisingly fun and re-affirmed how flippin awesome Scala is.  Code shrunk
and became more expressive, got to the core of what we were doing.</p>

<p>If you want to look at a few of the examples I did they&#39;re <a href="https://github.com/demian0311/security">up on GitHub</a>.</p>
