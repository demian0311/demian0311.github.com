<div class="post">
<p>First off, this is a small book.  72 pages including a glossary.  I was able to read
it on a plne ride from Louisiana to Denver.  Like the tagline says, I hope I never
need this book.  </p>

<p>As the title suggests, the book is about making Java more functional.  On my team 
we spend half our time in Groovy and half on Scala.  I suppose we 
have done similar things in Groovy.   The support that Groovy has for 
closures makes it easier than it would have been in Java.</p>

<p>He also covers what is coming in Java for more FP features like closures.  The 
syntax looks clunky but I could see living with it if I had no choice.  </p>

<p>I found the book useful in reviewing and appreciating where I&#39;m at.  How things 
were in Java and how nice things are in Scala.  Even if you don&#39;t need to do 
functional programming in Java right now I think this book is a good read.
If my current gig fell apart and I had to do Java fulltime then I would
grab this book to keep my sanity.</p>
