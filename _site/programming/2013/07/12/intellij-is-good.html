          <h2>Intellij Is Good</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Jul 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>This seems to be a theme lately where I&#39;m late to the party, taking a long time
to <em>get</em> something that is common knowledge to most folks.</p>

<h2>Groovy / Grails Support</h2>

<p>I was beating my head against the wall using <a href="http://grails.org/products/ggts">GGTS</a>.
For example it was astonishing to me that GGTS didn&#39;t understand that I should have a 
<a href="http://grails.org/doc/2.2.1/ref/Servlet%20API/request.html">request</a> available to me 
while working with Controllers.  No code completion, I was all on my own.  GGTS 
couldn&#39;t help me out at all.  Man I hope it&#39;s a PEBKAC problem but I couldn&#39;t get it working.</p>

<p>So I bit the bullet and started evaluating the newest version of IntelliJ.  After meeting
some resistance[^1] at work to justify the expense 
I decided to pay for a license out
of my own pocket.  That&#39;s how good I think it has been for my productivity.</p>

<h2>Scala and PlayFramework Support</h2>

<p>What I have done in my day job is use the <a href="http://scala-ide.org/">TypeSafe Scala IDE</a> 
for my Scala programming.  Really that wasn&#39;t going too bad at all.  TypeSafe is 
dog-fooding it and they&#39;re doing a pretty good job.  </p>

<p>IntelliJ also has great support for Scala and the PlayFramework.  After hours I&#39;m playing
with Play, no complaints there.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t fully pulled in our large Scala code-base at work quite yet.  We&#39;ll see how that
goes, not expecting much trouble.</p>

<h2>Productivity Boosters</h2>

<p>One of the big things to re-map &#8984;-R to re-run my last tests.  I do that in
Eclipse and it works out really good.  I&#39;m a very proficient with the keyboard but
day to day the function keys are dead to me.</p>

<p>Another big thing that has been helpful is the <a href="http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164">IdeaVim</a>
plugin.  It&#39;s 95% perfect for me.  I&#39;m real quick to get around using it.  The last
5% that doesn&#39;t work the way I want is really just indenting and outdenting a block
of text.  It doesn&#39;t work the same way VIM does.  It&#39;s great to be able to keep my
brain in VIM mode.</p>

<p>[^1]: It&#39;s not quite as bad as it sounds, they paid for an older version of IntelliJ for me
previously but I wanted them to pay for the latest version.</p>
